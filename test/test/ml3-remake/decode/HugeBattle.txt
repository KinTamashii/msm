Niiiiice, big bro!
I can already hear the dude crying!
Better make repairs while he's occupied!
Punch Attack
Yikes, bros! 
Gahaha! That's what you get for stomping on me when I was little!
Yowza! You really crushed it!
Wanna hear more about how to punch things in your temporarily ginormous state?
You can defend yourself against some attacks by punching. If you're successful, sometimes you'll even damage the enemy!
All right!
Fight, sir!
Wanna try again?
Let's practice punching with this airship!
Don't lose, Bowser!
Touch the Punch button.
 Leave it to me!
When you wind up a punch, an arrow appears over there.
Lord Bowser! The castle is weakened!
When it does, use the stylus to slide to the left quickly!
Now's your chance to end this with a final attack!
There you go! That's the Bowser I know and fear!
NOW! Tap the Final Attack icon and follow the prompts!
One more time?
EJECT ALL HEATED CARGO! 
Playing as giant Bowser, you'll face off against a giant enemy in this turn-based battle.
To win, you'll need to knock down your opponent's HP to 0—before it can do the same to you!
You can always tap the icon in the upper right corner for a refresher, OK?
You can really blast a ton of enemies with an EXCELLENT fire burst.
But be careful...if you wait too long to tap the screen, it'll fizzle out.
Want to practice some more?
LAST ATTACK SUCCESSFUL! 
BLACK HOLE PLUS BODY BLOW COMBO... 
ENEMY STILL ACTIVE. LAUNCH UNAVOIDABLE ATTACK AT ONCE!
All right! Let's toast these guys!
RESISTANCE USELESS! CONSUME THIS!
Aw, that again?! Come ON!
Battle Basics
Watch the fire growing in your mouth...
Need a little more practice with that?
Please! I'll blast that thing down with a fireball!
Look closely!
All right, try to wait until they get uncomfortably close...
The lake...
GAHAHA! See that? All Bowser, baby!
Ah! If you wait a little longer, the attack will be more powerful.
Now, quickly swipe left using the stylus or your finger.
Back here, too! 
SAFETY PROTOCOL SYSTEM ONLINE! 
Just a bit longer!
Remember, wait until an enemy is just about to reach you.
Look for it to appear on the right screen...
FRONTAL DEFENSE SYSTEMS FULLY OPERATIONAL! 
When your enemy has just a little HP left, you can unleash this devastating and stylish attack to end the battle. Tap the screen quickly and then finish by swiping fast circles on the touch screen or circle pad.
NOW!
If you tap the screen right now, you'll unleash the strongest attack.
Keep your eyes on that enemy...
Aw, you wanna fly away?! Tough luck, sucker!
Go ahead...tap the touch screen!
Ha! You're all wet!
Wanna try again?
Now I'm gonna pummel that head. Eat fists and fire, you overgrown garbage can!
What?! That did nothing! How am I supposed to wreck this thing? Maybe its head is vulnerable...
Full steam ahead!
Patch him up, boys!
...OK, he's actually pretty huge...
Wait a second...
Slide forward fast! The longer the slide, the better!
Fire Blast Time it right to inflict maximum damage.
It's floating!
Once you've initiated a Fire Blast, tap the touch screen when the fire flashes brightest to unleash the strongest attack. Watch carefully! If you wait too long to tap the screen, the attack will fail.
New entry added to the Guide!
Danger, bros! What do we do?
Sometimes you can defend yourself against projectile attacks by spitting fireballs. Just tap the screen to aim! Don't shoot too many fireballs too quickly, or they'll shrink or run out! You'll have to wait a while for them to regain power.
It's all good, bro! Check it out!
Brodingtons! Look! Over there! A rickety bridge!
That thing will collapse under this guy's bulk!
And then he'll fall allllllllll the way into the valley!
This big dude is going DOWN!
Nice, big bro! Total genius!
Let's cruise straight for the bridge station!
If we can pass that station, we win, bro! 
Distance to the bridge station is 100 kilomoles!
King Bowser!
He's coming! MOVE!
You got really big all of a sudden... Whoa. Did it like...hurt?
We stopped! Everything OK?
If you select Easy Mode, Bowser will get stronger and enemies will get weaker. This will not affect the story progression.
All right! Here comes some target practice!
Looks like Bowser... But far too big...
RECON UNIT!
You will deploy now. Identify that...thing.
Worry not, broskis!
That guy's punch is no prob!
Unless he spits fire... 
We'll take ZERO damage! 
Remember, you just have to tap the screen here to aim your fireballs.
Nice! Perfect!
Let's practice punching with this airship!
Punch Defense
You can aim anywhere within this area.
Touch the Punch button.
If you shoot too many fireballs quickly, they'll start getting weaker.
Now, slide to the left as fast as you can.
The faster you slide, the harder you hit!
And before long, you won't be able to shoot any more at all!
Go Bowser! You got all of 'em!
So make 'em count, OK?
Finishing Move
Fire Blast
Want a little more practice with fireballs?
Recovery Item
Whoa, a bunch of little enemy targets!
Clean 'em all up with fireballs!
Mushroom Restores Bowser's HP when eaten!
Not bad! But remember, you want to tap the screen when the fireball flashes brightest!
Touch the directions you want to spit fire.
What's your deal? 
Huh? Fireworks? Real festive...
Look out, here come a bunch of 'em at once.
Seems like a good excuse to use some fire!
You have grown giant. As has your cheating!
Huh? Nothing! Worst fireworks ever!
Touch the Flame button.
Instead of crying, why not get big too?!
Weird fireworks, pal... Real weird. Well... Moving on...
???
When the fire is fully charged, tap the touch screen!
You are a coward.
Time to deal with your ugly mug!
Skip battle and proceed in the story?
NOOO! That thing's sucking me in!
What's taking so long?! 
Get within range. Observe closely.
Don't even try it! 
Punch Attack The faster you slide, the stronger it hits.
Whoa, that one's closing fast! I better show you how to defend yourself. 
HEAT! HEAT! FIRE! FIRE!
When an enemy gets close, slide to the left quickly to punch 'em away.
FLAMMABLE BALLAST EJECT!  
NO PROBLEM.
Bro, was Bowser a pushover or what?
Totally. Lord Fawful is gonna be loving us.
I mean, you compare Bowser to the Fawful Express, and it's like, "Broski. Dude is PUNY."
BAHAHAHAHAHA!
SAFETY PROTOCOL ERROR! FULL DEFENSE SHUTDOWN! 
Uh-oh... What in the...
BOO SYSTEM ONLINE! INVISIBILITY FIELD NOW OPERATIONAL! 
ENEMY EVASIVE MANEUVERS NULL! 
Whoa, bro! Let's get out of here!
ENEMY STILL ACTIVE. QUERY: CAN IT SURVIVE THIS?
Wanna try again?
What a blast!
Hold on, hold on... He got bigger, but we can still take him, bro.
TAKING A STEP BACK WILL END THIS...
That's our Bowser! Perfect flame!
You think? We are in a train... What the heck. Choo-choo, brosephine!
ACTIVATE BLACK HOLE ENDGAME!
ENEMY STRENGTH IS ADMIRABLE! 
BUT YOU ARE FINISHED!
All right, take a deep breath, aim...then tap when ready!
What a blast!
HOLD IT!
Return to normal size. Only then do I fight!
Finishing Move Use this move to end the fight!
That's our Bowser! Perfect punch!
If you get a Mushroom during battle, you can use it to restore some of your HP.
However, using a Mushroom will forfeit your next attack, so consider the battle situation carefully before proceeding.
What? What is this?!
The ca... The castle...
Whuh—what is THAT?!
Slide your finger or the stylus from right to left as quickly as possible to perform a Punch Attack. The faster the slide, the stronger the punch!
Fire Defense
