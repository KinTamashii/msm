\code[9,0,6]What ARE those things?!\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_op2_12}
\code[9,0,6]You mean because Lord Bowser\\
isn't really Lord Bowser?\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst1_17}
\code[9,0,10]Welp! It is what it is.\\
Let's go, team!\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst4_15}

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_21}
\code[9,0,6]We're not really going\\

What? How did you know?!\wait

\code[9,0,6]What would you have\\
us do, Captain?\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_op2_14}
\code[9,0,6]That's Lord Bowser's body,\\
but his mind...\wait \pagebreak
His mind is being controlled\\
by someone else.\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst1_19}
\code[9,0,6]For crying out loud... I think we scraped\\
the bottom of the captain barrel.\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst4_17}
\code[9,0,6]♪He's gone! He's gone! Fawfully-doo!\\
Just like, soon, the one who is you!♪\wait

\code[9,0,6]My friends! My BROTHERS!\\
Our journey is at its end.\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_op2_15}
\code[9,0,6]\code[1,1]Fawful said Lord Bowser is\\
"not of this world anymore."\wait \pagebreak
Yet there he was, acting really odd.\\
It's the only logical explanation.\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst4_18}
\code[9,0,10]I...will...DESTROY YOU!!\code[2,0,600]

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_24}
\code[9,0,6]If we survive this next trial,\\
Lord Bowser awaits us.\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst4_19}
\code[9,0,6]Go ahead and have searchings\\
for all of the eternities! Hah!\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_25}
\code[9,0,6]It's a double-edged sword\\
to admit this, but...\wait \pagebreak
Mario and Green Guy will\\
surely defeat that faker.\wait \pagebreak
Those guys are so strong...\\
It make me SO MAD...\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_op2_18}
\code[9,0,6]Huh. It's weird hearing you talk so much.\\
You're usually such a shy...um...fella.\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_op2_19}
\code[9,0,6]Yeah, well, this really makes me mad.\\
I refuse to let this go unpunished.\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_28}
\code[9,0,6]Anyway, that will give us the chance\\
to rescue the real Lord Bowser.\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_29}
\code[9,0,6]And this time, we won't fail! We'll be at\\
our king's side before the day is done!\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst1_30}
\code[9,0,6]N-No... I'm really not...\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst1_31}
\code[9,0,6]I don't get it... How could a single\\
Goomba do such great things...\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst1_32}
\code[9,0,6]I may just be a weak,\\
run-of-the-mill Goomba...\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst1_33}
\code[9,0,6]What's wrong, Ludwig?\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst1_34}
\code[9,0,6]Nothing... I just have a lot on\\
my mind. Let's get moving!\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_1}
\code[9,0,10]Hey, you! Imposter face!\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_2}
\code[9,0,6]Fawful... The one called Goomba\\
has seen through my disguise.\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_3}
\code[9,0,6]\code[1,1]Do not concern yourself with sad\\
worryings over pesky Goombas!\wait \pagebreak
\code[1,0]My plans of backup are having\\
their own plans of backup!\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_40}
\code[9,0,6]Whether we're up against weird\\
machines...or weirder Fawful...\wait \pagebreak
Whether it's the green Mario Bro...\\
or even Mario himself...\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst3_10}
\code[9,0,6]You really think so?!\\
Heh. Heheh. Heehee.\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_4}
\code[9,0,6]You might as well surrender! It's the\\
end of the line for you jerks!\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_41}
\code[9,0,6]From this moment on, no matter what\\
challenge we face, we WILL prevail!\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst3_11}
\code[9,0,6]Watch it, Goomba breath! Don't go\\
getting a big head over this!\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_42}
\code[9,0,6]So let's go show the world\\
what we're made of!\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_5}
\code[9,0,6]These puny worms have\\
a point, I'm afraid.\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst3_12}
\code[9,0,6]Ah, sorry! \code[2,0,10]My head will remain roughly\\
as proportional as it currently is, sir!\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_43}
\code[9,0,6]This is for all the marbles!\\
For our king!\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst5_6}
\code[9,0,6]Mario and his green sidekick\\
will be here soon.\wait 

\string{krpg_koopa_qst3_13}
\code[9,0,6]This doesn't mean it's over, either.\\
You're just one step closer.\wait \pagebreak
Goomba!\code[2,0,60] No...CAPTAIN Goomba.\\
You're OK in my book.\wait

\code[9,0,6]Yeah! This is for you,\\
Lord Bowser!!\wait

brave ranks of Bowser's Minions.\wait \pagebreak

saying somethin' nice!\wait

I slipped in among the shells of this\\

What's with the rhymes?\wait \pagebreak
I mean, I love me some good rhymes,\\

rhymes make the mood lighter.\wait

the Toad village up ahead!\wait \pagebreak
You guys are in for a beating\\
if you get in his way!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_3}
\code[9,0,6]Parting ways with Corporal Paraplonk\\

turn you into Minion dust!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst2_20}

Why, cruel world?\wait \pagebreak
All I want is for us to go and save\\

\code[9,0,6]Is that your intimidation pose?\\
It's pretty lame...\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst2_22}
\code[9,0,6]We are NOT buddies. And once we're\\
all squared, you'd better beat it!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_6}
\code[9,0,6]♪All my Goombas, put your\\
feeeet in the aiiiir!♪\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst1_17}
\code[9,0,6]Come on! Let's fight!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst2_23}
\code[9,0,6]Deal! You'll bean it and\\
I'll beat it! Heh!\code[2,0,120]

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_7}
\code[9,0,6]Just kidding. I simply prefer\\
the company of Goombas.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst1_1}
\code[9,0,6]Pleeease! Help meeee!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst1_18}
\code[9,0,6]Look, up ahead! It's that Toad village\\
Master Morton is trying to conquer...\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst2_24}
\code[9,0,6]I have 10 of those beans\\
to spare anyway...\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_8}
\code[9,0,6]I see. So... Are you still\\
Fawful's underling?\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst1_19}
\code[9,0,6]But if we unbrainwash Master Morton,\\
we'll be saving those Toads. Ew.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst1_2}
\code[9,0,6]AHH! MORE Minions?! There goes\\
the neighborhood...\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_9}
\code[9,0,6]We're ALL Lord Fawful's underlings!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst1_3}
\code[9,0,6]Huh? What's a diabolical\\
Toad doing here?\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst6_30}
\code[9,0,6]Ah. Yes. That would be why\\
I said I was sorry.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst1_4}
\code[9,0,6]STOP HIM.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst6_31}
\code[9,0,6]If sayin' "sorry" fixed everything, bein' a\\
master thief would be a lot easier.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst1_5}
\code[9,0,6]GRAB TOAD.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst6_32}
\code[9,0,6]Consider this the final part\\
of the audition!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst1_6}
\code[9,0,6]Master Morton!\\
Snap out of it!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst6_33}
\code[9,0,9]Whichever one of ya can\\
take down these punks...\wait \pagebreak
will have the distinct honor\\
of bein' my new partner!\wait

to be kidding me!\wait \pagebreak
You guys are really gonna\\
help that stinky Toad?!\wait

\code[9,0,6]Are you all right, darling?\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst1_8}
\code[9,0,6]No! Of course not! I promise you,\\
that's not it at all...\wait \pagebreak
It's just that Master Morton was\\
hit by Fawful's evil spray, so...\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst5_10}
\code[9,0,6]WHAT HAPPEN TO BOWSER?!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst6_35}
\code[9,0,6]Welp. Back to square one...\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst1_9}
\code[9,0,6]Hey! Wait!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst5_11}
\code[9,0,6]Phew! Only three Koopalings\\
left to unbrainwash.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst6_36}
\code[9,0,6]*sigh* Let's go...\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst5_12}
\code[9,0,6]We're going to fight the rest\\
of the Koopalings too?!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst6_37}
\code[9,0,6]Lord Bowser...\\
I hope you're OK...\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst5_13}
\code[9,0,6]Keeheehee! It's not as\\
hopeless as it sounds.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst5_14}
\code[9,0,6]Even if our power level leaves\\
much to be desired...\wait \pagebreak
If we stick together, there's no enemy\\
we can't overcome!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst5_15}
\code[9,0,6]All of our Minion spirit will\\
gather together...\wait \pagebreak
It will grow our small squad\\
into a giant army!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst2_40}
\code[9,0,6]Acting self-important is very\\
captain-like behavior.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst5_16}
\code[9,0,6]One that can save Lord Bowser!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst2_36_2}
\code[9,0,6]I better not see your\\
ugly face again!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst2_41}
\code[9,0,6]It is? Oh! I'll work on that...\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst5_17}
\code[9,0,6]So, yeah. We'll be fine.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst2_42}
\code[9,0,6]Now then! Let's move out!\\
Follow me!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst5_18}
\code[9,0,6]All of us WILL make it back\\
to Bowser's Castle!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_10}
\code[9,0,6]No, wait! That's not accurate.\\
That was from earlier.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst5_19}
\code[9,0,6]But until then, everybody...\\
please give it your all...\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_11}
\code[9,0,6]I, Private Goomp, have come\\
to a decision!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_12}
\code[9,0,6]And that decision is...to...\\
Huh. What did I decide again?\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_13}
\code[9,0,6]That's enough, Private Goomp.\\
We've HAD this conversation.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_14}
\code[9,0,6]You're the one who started it!\\
You must be sooo embarrassed.\wait \pagebreak
\code[1,1]Now listen up!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst4_20}
\code[9,0,6]In the beginning, all of this\\
frightened even yours truly...\wait \pagebreak
But now I'm a top-tier super captain,\\
saving Lord Bowser one win at a time!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_15}
\code[9,0,6]Private Goomp, you really should\\
just go ahead and join us.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst4_21}
\code[9,0,6]He's complimenting himself again...\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_16}
\code[9,0,6]Oh. I should?\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst4_22}
\code[9,0,6]Oh, I know! You can be a\\
captain too!\wait \pagebreak
That's a surefire way to\\
boost your confidence!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_17}
\code[9,0,6]It's the perfect pairing if you're\\
looking for a Goomba team.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst4_23}
\code[9,0,6]Me... Could it be?\\
A captain? Well then!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_18}
\code[9,0,6]You'll also get a fancy Bonus Skill.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst4_24}
\code[9,0,6]Yeah... I think...I'll give it a shot!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_19}
\code[9,0,6]Oooh... I like fancy...\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst4_25}
\code[9,0,6]If I'm a \color[44,100,255,255]captain\color[55,55,55,255], good things\\
will \color[44,100,255,255]happen\color[55,55,55,255]!\wait \pagebreak
Wait! You said good time to rhyme!\code[2,0,10]\\
Nice one! Ahahahaha!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst4_26}
\code[9,0,6]Is this guy's head screwed on right?\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst4_27}
\code[9,0,6]Let's get \color[44,100,255,255]crackin'\color[55,55,55,255]! Or my lips\\
will keep on \color[44,100,255,255]smackin'\color[55,55,55,255]!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst4_28}
\code[9,0,6]He's just excited... And hey,\\
this'll lighten things up!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst4_29}
\code[9,0,6]This Koopa Troopa's in charge, livin' large!\code[2,0,10]\\
Best captain around, from sky to ground!\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_30}
\code[9,0,6]Sure. Whatever.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst6_1}
\code[9,0,6]That thief who was with Lord Bowser\\
should be somewhere around here...\wait \pagebreak
Hopefully Bowser is still with him.\wait 

\string{krpg_dehe_qst3_31}

saying the strangest things...\wait \pagebreak
\code[1,1]He was all "Lord Fawful" this\\

Like MUTINY!\wait

\code[9,0,6]Yes, it's settled!\\
You're coming with us!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kvsk_end_6}
\code[9,0,6]No... How could this happen...\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_11}
\code[9,0,6]It's safer to go as a group\\
than to go it alone.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_12}
\code[9,0,6]Uh, sure. I'm fine with that.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_13}
\code[9,0,6]Wow. That was easier\\
than expected.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_14}
\code[9,0,6]Hooray! I got another ally!\\
Let's try our best, OK?\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_15}
\code[9,0,6]So that flag... Does that mean you're\\
in charge? Or just that you're fancy?\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_20}
\code[9,0,6]Hey! Your formation looks awfully\\
similar to ours too! That's low!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_16}
\code[9,0,6]It does! The first one, I mean.\\
I'm the captain of this squad.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_21}
\code[9,0,6]It's really not similar at all...\wait

MAYDAY!!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_30}
\code[9,0,6]Wait! STOP!!\wait

\code[9,0,9]Quiet, Goomba Squad! Prepare to\\
battle the Goomp Squad!\wait \pagebreak
Whoever loses has to surrender\\

find Lord Bowser?!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_31}
\code[9,0,6]Lord Bowser...is gone?\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_18}
\code[9,0,6]\code[1,1]Oh? You can see it too?\wait \pagebreak
I wasn't sure at first, but I guess\\
I really do have what it takes!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_23}
\code[9,0,6]Umm... Why don't we all just work\\
together and be friends?\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_3}
\code[9,0,6]N-No. I haven't found\\
Lord Bowser yet. But...\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_32}
\code[9,0,6]What...does that mean?\\
Where'd he go?\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_1}
\code[9,0,6]Huzzah! One of our own!\\
Are you OK, soldier?\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_19}
\code[9,0,6]That's the finest aura of\\
stupidity I've ever seen.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_24}
\code[9,0,9]Unacceptable! I will recruit ALL of the\\
Minions and make a name for myself!\wait \pagebreak
Nothing good can come of blurring the\\
line between leader and subordinate!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_33}
\code[9,0,6]I don't know, but I aim to find out.\\
Quickly! To the Koopa Cruiser!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_4}
\code[9,0,6]I DID find the Koopa Cruiser!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_2}
\code[9,0,6]What in Bowser's name?!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_25}
\code[9,0,9]Sergeant Guy!\\
Corporal Paraplonk!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_34}
\code[9,0,6]We'll take the Koopa Cruiser to\\
Bowser's Castle and fix all of this!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_5}
\code[9,0,6]Wait. Didn't the Koopa Cruiser\\
blow up? I'm pretty sure it did.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_3}
\code[9,0,6]What are you doing?! Don't tell me\\
Fawful brainwashed you too...\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_26}
\code[9,0,9]We're on it!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_35}
\code[9,0,4]\code[1,1]Without warning, the plot thickens...\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_6}
\code[9,0,6]I don't know why the Koopa Cruiser\\
is back, but it is!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_4}
\code[9,0,6]Wait... We're on the same side?\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_27}
\code[9,0,9]Battle Formation Alpha!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_36}
\code[9,0,4]\code[1,1]Captain Goomba and the other Minions\\
never dreamed their beloved home,\\
Bowser's Castle, could be taken over...\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_7}
\code[9,0,6]You have to believe me!\\
Just go scope it out, OK?\wait \pagebreak
It will undoubtedly help us in\\
our search for Lord Bowser.\wait \pagebreak
And maybe it will even help us fly\\
back home to Bowser's Castle!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_5}
\code[9,0,6]Phew! Thank goodness. You're not\\
brainwashed after all. Just slow.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_1}
\code[9,0,6]I could have sworn I saw a\\
Stalking Piranha Plant here...\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_28}
\code[9,0,6]Should we just ignore him?\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_37}
\code[9,0,4]\code[1,1]And what's this nonsense about\\
Lord Bowser no longer being\\
"a thing that is of this world"?\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_8}
\code[9,0,6]Your plan is a stupid plan\\
full of grubby grub holes!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_6}
\code[9,0,6]You should know whose side someone's\\
on before throwing turnips at them!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_2}
\code[9,0,6]Blargh! There's no one here!\wait \pagebreak
I'd feel better if we recruited\\
some more Minions soon.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_29}
\code[9,0,6]We can't. Those three are\\
high-ranking Minions...\wait \pagebreak
Let's win this and recruit them!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_38}
\code[9,0,4]\code[1,1]If things continue down this path,\\
the Minions will have no home to\\
return to, and no king to serve...\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_9}
\code[9,0,6]There is no home for you to be having.\\
Your home-having plans are for naught!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_7}
\code[9,0,6]Listen, jerk. The Minions are acting\\
crazy. They've been attacking me!\wait \pagebreak
That's why I turnip any Minion\\
I run into, no questions asked.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_3}
\code[9,0,6]Hey, you! Hold on a minute!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_39}
\code[9,0,4]\code[1,1]With heavy hearts, Captain Goomba and\\
his Minions rushed to the Koopa Cruiser,\\
their minds racing with worrisome thoughts...\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_8}
\code[9,0,6]I...see where you're coming from.\wait \pagebreak
(It's a good thing I'm a master dodger.)\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_4}
\code[9,0,6]Heh heh heh! Greetings, friend! I see\\
you are not a talking rock after all.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_30}
\code[9,0,6]Oh. Right. I know these things.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_9}
\code[9,0,6]OK, so our first order of business is\\
to un-brainwash our fellow Minions.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_5}
\code[9,0,6]What? Really? \code[2,0,30]Heehee...\\
I could get used to this.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_31}
\code[9,0,6]If the captain is weak, the entire\\
squad is weak as well.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_6}
\code[9,0,6]Indeed! Goombas are famously the\\
first ones Mario always stomps!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_32}
\code[9,0,5]Ah... I suppose that's true.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_7}
\code[9,0,6]Wow... That one hurt. I guess I can't\\
be mad at the truth, though.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_7_2}
\code[9,0,6]Anyway. Smug guy! Have you seen\\
any Piranha Plants around here?\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_1}
\code[9,0,9]W-Wait!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_33}
\code[9,0,6]Learn this stuff on your own\\
and your skills will improve.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_8}
\code[9,0,6]I cannot say that I have, as that\\
would be an untruth!\wait \pagebreak
As it were, I haven't time to chat.\wait \pagebreak
Forgive my manners. I must away now!\\
May we meet again!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_2}
\code[9,0,6]Oh! Private Goomp!\\
Thank goodness you're safe!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_34}
\code[9,0,6]...Hey! Wait just a minute!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_9}

\code[9,0,6]Wrong again! We are LORD Fawful's\\
very topmost underlings!\wait

\code[9,0,6]Lord Bowser? Kidnapped?\\
Don't be ridiculous!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_op1_11}
\code[9,0,6]Ya wouldn't think it, but he's\\

\string{krpg_mame_op1_12}
\code[9,0,6]Bahahaha!\wait

\code[9,0,6]I thought we'd stand a chance against\\
Fawful with the Koopalings on our side...\wait \pagebreak
I never dreamed they'd join the enemy!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_op1_13}
\code[9,0,6]You looking for trouble, buddy?\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kvsk_end_11}
\code[9,0,6]It's OK! I've got an idea!\\
We'll beat the Koopalings...\wait \pagebreak
Knock the washing from their brains\\

\string{krpg_mame_op1_14}
\code[9,0,6]Ah... Ahem...\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kvsk_end_12}
\code[9,0,6]You say that like it's so\\

\code[9,0,6]I was just on my way out.\\
My sincerest apologies!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kvsk_end_13}
\code[9,0,6]\code[1,1]I'm not sure how yet...\wait \pagebreak
But we'll have to become even\\

\code[9,0,6]Well, looks like we have no choice\\
but to find them ourselves.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_op1_16}
\code[9,0,6]In any case, there's no point arguing\\
until we catch sight of Lord Bowser.\wait \pagebreak
We'll just have to split up\\

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kvsk_end_14}
\code[9,0,6]So...what do you think?\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_11}
\code[9,0,6]Piranha Plant! Oh, PIRANHA PLANT!\\
Where are youuuuu?!\wait

\code[9,0,6]That is as pointless as dulled pencils\\
used for letters to nobodies!\wait

\code[9,0,6]Are you idiots deaf or something?\\
Get lost before we—\wait

\code[9,0,6]Yeah! Acting without thinking!\\
That's the Minion way!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_13}

\string{krpg_mame_op1_19}
\code[9,0,6]Hah and hah again!\wait \pagebreak

Now! Have the saying of my name!\wait

\code[9,0,6]Let's follow Captain Goomba's plan.\\

As for me, I'll go and scout out\\
the other Minions.\wait

\code[9,0,6]W-Wait! I'll be the first to admit\\
I look a bit like a muffin, but...\wait \pagebreak
I taste like yuck! No amount of frying\\
or aioli would make a difference!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kvsk_end_18}
\code[9,0,6]We're counting on you, Lakitu!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_15}
\code[9,0,6]Mmm... Deep frying and aioli...\\
That actually sounds really good.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kvsk_end_19}
\code[9,0,4]\code[1,1]Defeat the Koopalings to recruit them,\color[255,250,241,255]\\
\code[1,1]and then go rescue Lord Bowser!\wait \pagebreak
\code[1,1]The Minions are determined to stand up to\\
a powerful foe they've never faced before.\\
Will they succeed? Only time will tell...\wait \color[230,230,230,255]

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_16}
\code[9,0,10]I mean! That's not the point!\wait

\code[9,0,10]Please! Let me goooo!!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_18}
\code[9,0,6]Hmm. You're different from the\\
Piranha Plants we have at home.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_mpackun_19}
\code[9,0,6]Yeah, this must be a variety that's\\
native to the Beanbean Kingdom.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_10}
\code[9,0,9]NO! Wait... That's wrong too...\\
That's from when my brain was fuzzy.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_op1_30}
\code[9,0,6]All...\\
Lor...\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_11}
\code[9,0,6]Um, so what decision\\
did you come to?\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_20}
\code[9,0,6]Wow. That's a skosh demoralizing.\wait \pagebreak
Our castle was taken.\\
We're all quite shaken.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_op1_31}
\code[9,0,10]All hail Lord Fawful!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_12}
\code[9,0,6]Oh, right! I, Private Goomp,\\
have made up my mind!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_21}
\code[9,0,6]Your rhyming is unspecial and full of\\
cringe! Now is the time of good-bye!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_op1_32}
\code[9,0,6]Ah! The ringings of that sound are as\\
sweet as particularly sticky treats!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_13}
\code[9,0,6]What was it I decided...?\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_22}
\code[9,0,6]Hey! You stop right there!\\
Apologize to my friend!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_op1_33}
\code[9,0,6]But that Goomba... I am wanting to wash\\
his brain even more than the Koopalings!\wait \pagebreak
I suppose I will have forgettings\\
of him for the time that is now...\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_14}
\code[9,0,6]To gather all the Minions!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_23}
\code[9,0,5]It's OK, Cap. There really\\
wasn't much to it...\code[2,0,150]

\string{krpg_mame_op1_34}
\code[9,0,9]That's SO rude. Let's teach\\
these freaks some manners!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_15}
\code[9,0,6]And rescue Lord Bowser!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_24}
\code[9,0,6]"Taken" and "shaken"! Get it?!\\
It was a delightful rhyme!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_16}
\code[9,0,6]That's right! And to score a big,\\
fat compliment from Lord Bowser!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_25}
\code[9,0,6]Hah! I have one more sprinkle for\\
your cupcake of despair!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_17}
\code[9,0,6]Oh, really? You care about\\
Lord Bowser again?\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_26}
\code[9,0,6]The Lord Bowser that you\\
have such loooove for...\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_op1_1}
\code[9,0,6]Did ya find him?\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_18}
\code[9,0,6]What? Really?!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_27}
\code[9,0,6]He is no longer a thing that\\
is of this world!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_op1_2}
\code[9,0,6]Nope. Can't find him anywhere!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_rival_19}
\code[9,0,6]So...you heard my idea somewhere\\
and decided to copy me! Devious!\wait 

\string{krpg_joke_op1_28}
\code[9,0,6]WHAT?!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_op1_3}
\code[9,0,6]How 'bout you?\wait

\code[9,0,6]You can't mean...\wait

\code[9,0,6]Don't you think I would have said\\
something if I'd found him?\wait

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_20}
\code[9,0,9]Hey! That's not nice!\wait

How is this happening...\wait \pagebreak
If we don't do something quick,\\
we'll be laughing stocks!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_21}
\code[9,0,6]I know. I'll be the captain too. It's a\\
bad idea for you to be the only one.\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_op1_7}
\code[9,0,9]What are you freaks doing here?!\\
This is OUR turf! Buzz off!\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_qst_kabu_22}
\code[9,0,6]What?! We're going to have\\
TWO captains? That's silly...\wait 

\string{krpg_mame_op1_8}
\code[9,0,6]We've looked all over and\\
haven't found squat...\wait \pagebreak
Does that mean Lord Bowser\\
was kidnapped?!\wait

the \color[44,100,255,255]Power Triangle\color[55,55,55,255]?\wait

\code[9,0,9]Hey! Don't you dare ignore us!\wait

\code[9,0,6]Huh? Yeah... I basically\\
wrote the basics on it.\wait

\string{krpg_ufu_qst2_5}
\code[9,0,6]What's on your mind, Cap?\wait

Well, it isn't easy.\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst3_12}

Sorry about Lord Bowser...\\
Send him our best regards!\wait

\string{krpg_ufu_qst4_22}
\code[9,0,6]You don't understand! Lord Bowser\\
is in big trouble right now!\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst3_17}
\code[9,0,6]Now! Let us move onward to the\\
poundings of my enemies!\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst4_23}

\code[9,0,6]Come on. Why don't you\\
join us? Pretty please?\wait

like an enemy. Even Lord Bowser...\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst4_25}
\code[9,0,6]This situation seems complicated.\\
We hate complicated things!\wait

By the way...\code[2,0,8] You look supercool\\

Who built a wall here?!\wait

\code[9,0,6]Geez, this guy sure is slow on the\\
uptake. He doesn't seem to get it...\wait

\code[9,0,6]Really?\code[2,0,20]\\
Heh. I'm cool...\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst2_23}

An aura of stupidity...\wait

Wait up!\wait

\code[9,0,6]Welp. That went poorly.\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst4_46}
\code[9,0,6]Now then! Bowser's Minions!\code[2,0,10]\\
Awaaay we go!\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst5_13}
\code[9,0,6]It's all crystal clear now. If I go\\

...the Koopalings might change\\
their minds about me!\wait

so quickly? It's not very Minion-y.\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst1_21}
\code[9,0,6]Hmm. Ya know, this might\\
be a good idea after all.\wait \pagebreak
We could use another\\
member for the squad.\wait

\code[9,0,6]Yeah, that's true.\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst5_1}

Master Ludwig!\wait

the Koopalings are unharmed?\wait

what now?\code[2,0,10] Speak up, I say!\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst5_3}
\code[9,0,6]Huh. I thought a pebble was talking,\\
but it's just a dumb Goomba.\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst1_25}
\code[9,0,6]Whatever it is, I promise to\\
rise to the challenge!\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst5_4}
\code[9,0,6]Not that it's your business, but we're\\
in search of Lord Bowser.\wait \pagebreak
Time is of the essence, so we can't\\
waste any of it talking to Goombas.\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst1_26}
\code[9,0,6]Cool. Together, we'll find our fellow\\
Minions and rebuild our ranks!\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst5_5}
\code[9,0,6]Lord Bowser went flying that way,\\
towards the mountain!\wait \pagebreak
But watch out! A weird guy with\\
odd verbiage might spray you!\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst1_27}
\code[9,0,6]Ooh, I love this plan!\\
It's a great and grand plan!\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst5_6}

this nutty Goomba is saying...\wait 

\string{krpg_ufu_qst1_28}

the Goomba way!\wait \pagebreak
A good old-fashioned team-up\\

Stop listening to that Goomba\\
