All right, it's up to you to manage your squad formations from here on out, Lord Junior.
It looks like we're up against melee troopers next, so I'd recommend adding flying troopers.
I'd say...three Boos should be enough.
Well...that's certainly enough from me. I'll leave you to it. Good luck, Lord Junior!

It looks like we'll be taking on some flying enemies.
So, you know, we should make sure our squad can handle them!
Item(s) acquired!
This is where you can swap troopers in and out of your squad.
So, like I said, since we'll be up against some flying troopers...
It'd make sense to add some ranged troopers of our own.
