\string
Allow me to teach you how \\
one battles in giant form.

\string


\string
First, \color[44,101,255,255]jumping\color[0,0,0,255].

\string
Shall I teach you how to \\
perform the \color[44,101,255,255]jump attack\color[0,0,0,255]?

\string


\string


\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Touch \color[0,0,0,255]the \color[44,101,255,255]Jump icon\color[0,0,0,255].

\string
Once you're in a ready\\
crouch, an \color[44,101,255,255]arrow \color[0,0,0,255]will appear.

\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Slide \color[0,0,0,255]in the \color[44,101,255,255]arrow's direction\color[0,0,0,255],\\
\color[44,101,255,255]\color[0,0,0,255]and you will jump, but...

\string


\string
Do not slide right away!\\
Await the charged-up \color[44,101,255,255]sign\color[0,0,0,255]!

\string


\string


\string
Now \color[44,101,255,255]slide upward \color[0,0,0,255]to jump!

\string
Now is your \color[44,101,255,255]time\color[0,0,0,255]! Your arms\\
spread! Light shines forth!

\string


\string


\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Slide upward \color[0,0,0,255]again to\\
leap ever higher!

\string
Stomp after charging and\\
the \color[44,101,255,255]arrow \color[0,0,0,255]appears again!

\string
It's vital that you wait for\\
the charged-up \color[44,101,255,255]sign\color[0,0,0,255]!

\string


\string


\string


\string


\string


\string


\string


\string


\string
Now your foe attacks...\\
\color[44,101,255,255]Jump\color[0,0,0,255] to avoid its barrage!

\string


\string


\string


\string


\string
Look! A tornado lingers\\
in the dreamy distance!

\string
Shall I teach you how one \\
performs a \color[44,101,255,255]hammer attack\color[0,0,0,255]?

\string
A \color[44,101,255,255]hammer attack\color[0,0,0,255] will hurl \\
the foe into its windy maw!

\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Touch \color[0,0,0,255]the \color[44,101,255,255]Hammer icon\color[0,0,0,255].

\string
Next, you must \color[44,101,255,255]touch \color[0,0,0,255]the \\
\color[44,101,255,255]Hammer Chop icon\color[0,0,0,255].

\string
As you take your hammering\\
stance, an \color[44,101,255,255]arrow \color[0,0,0,255]will appear.

\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Slide \color[0,0,0,255]quickly in the\\
\color[44,101,255,255]arrow's direction\color[0,0,0,255]!

\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Slide quickly to the left \color[0,0,0,255]to \\
swing the hammer sideways.

\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Slide quickly to the right \color[0,0,0,255]to \\
swing the hammer sideways.

\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Hammer Chops\color[0,0,0,255] always hit\\
foes into the \color[44,101,255,255]background\color[0,0,0,255]!

\string


\string


\string


\string


\string


\string


\string


\string
Counter with the \color[44,101,255,255]hammer\color[0,0,0,255]!

\string


\string


\string


\string


\string


\string
You OK, Dreamy Luigi?!

\string


\string
Your HP has fallen!

\string
You must work with Mario\\
to \color[44,101,255,255]restore your HP\color[0,0,0,255]!

\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Touch \color[0,0,0,255]the \color[44,101,255,255]Bros. Attack\\
icon\color[0,0,0,255].

\string
Then you must \color[44,101,255,255]touch \color[0,0,0,255]the \\
\color[44,101,255,255]Rhythm Mushroom icon\color[0,0,0,255].

\string
Mario will throw \\
Mushrooms rhythmically.\\
Be at one with the rhythm!

\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Tap\color[0,0,0,255] the screen with \\
the same rhythm to \\
eat the Mushrooms!

\string
You must give it a try!\code[3,0,10]\\
Forward!

\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Tap\color[0,0,0,255] the screen in rhythm \\
to eat the Mushrooms!

\string


\string
One thing slipped my mind...

\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Bros. Attacks \color[0,0,0,255]cannot be \\
used consecutively.

\string
Ah yes, Mario must rest a\\
bit after he uses his power.

\string


\string
That should be enough\\
for you to fell this foe!

\string
Dreamy Luigi! \code[3,0,10]Mario!\code[3,0,15]\\
Be at one with victory!

\string
It is time!\code[3,0,10] The foe is weak\\
and ripe for defeat!

\string
Finish it off with the \\
\color[44,101,255,255]Finishing Bros.\color[0,0,0,255]!

\string
Now \color[44,101,255,255]touch \color[0,0,0,255]the \\
\color[44,101,255,255]Finishing Bros. icon\color[0,0,0,255].

\string
Tilt the Nintendo 3DS to\\
set the \color[44,101,255,255]marker \color[0,0,0,255]on the foe!

\string
YOU DARE\\
CHALLENGE ME?!

\string
That should even things!

\string
Use the hammer this time!

\string
That looks...impenetrable.

\string
If only there was a way\\
to break his guard...

\string
\size[150]GRAWWWR!\size[100]

\string
Ah! \code[3,0,10]Why not try the\\
\color[44,101,255,255]Hammer Uppercut\color[0,0,0,255]?

\string
I'm well trained in \color[44,101,255,255]Hammer \\
Uppercuts\color[0,0,0,255]. Shall I teach you?

\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Touch \color[0,0,0,255]the \color[44,101,255,255]Hammer icon\color[0,0,0,255].

\string
Now you must \color[44,101,255,255]touch \color[0,0,0,255]the \\
\color[44,101,255,255]Hammer Uppercut icon\color[0,0,0,255].

\string


\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Slide \color[0,0,0,255]quickly in the \color[44,101,255,255]arrow's\\
direction\color[0,0,0,255] to swing the\\
hammer vertically!

\string
Quickly \color[44,101,255,255]slide upward \color[0,0,0,255]to \\
swing the hammer vertically.

\string
That \color[44,101,255,255]Hammer Uppercut\color[0,0,0,255]\\
launched the foe \color[44,101,255,255]backward\color[0,0,0,255]!

\string
Now for it, Dreamy Luigi!\code[3,0,10]\\
He sprawls defenseless!

\string
Work with Mario and unleash\\
a \color[44,101,255,255]Bros. Attack\color[0,0,0,255]!

\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Touch \color[0,0,0,255]the \color[44,101,255,255]Bros. Attack\\
icon\color[0,0,0,255].

\string
Now \color[44,101,255,255]touch \color[0,0,0,255]the \color[44,101,255,255]Drill Stomp\\
icon\color[0,0,0,255].

\string
Make \color[44,101,255,255]circles\color[0,0,0,255] in the \color[44,101,255,255]arrow's\\
direction \color[0,0,0,255]to make Mario\\
spin faster!

\string
If you make lots of\color[44,101,255,255] circles\color[0,0,0,255],\\
the \color[44,101,255,255]arrow\color[0,0,0,255] will appear again. \\
Then make \color[44,101,255,255]more circles\color[0,0,0,255]!

\string
Now spin in the other\\
direction! Be ever mindful!

\string
When the \color[44,101,255,255]Drill Stomp \color[0,0,0,255]ends,\\
Mario will flag and need rest,\\
as with Rhythm Mushroom.

\string
You won't be able to use\\
\color[44,101,255,255]Bros. Attacks \color[0,0,0,255]for a bit, so\\
make use of them wisely!

\string
\size[150]NOW I'MA GET\\
SUPERHEATED!\size[100]

\string


\string


\string
I have a plan! Drive it into\\
the \color[44,101,255,255]sea\color[0,0,0,255], and then attack it!

\string
Dreamy Luigi!\code[3,0,10] Focus!\\
Don't wig out!

\string
Be at one with defeating \\
this giant...town...monster.

\string
Good! \code[3,0,10]Keep up this pace\\
to drop it into the \color[44,101,255,255]sea\color[0,0,0,255]!

\string
That attack doesn't appear\\
to be very effective.

\string


\string
Success! \code[3,0,10]When it emerges,\\
bonk it over and over!

\string


\string
So much armor! You won't\\
be able to move it at all!

\string
And it would take too long\\
to destroy it piecemeal...

\string
But perhaps a strong enough\\
attack would break all of it!

\string
Ah. Armor. Looks heavy!\code[3,0,10]\\
Budging it will be tough...

\string
If only you could break it...

Use that move to finish it!\\
You know! THAT move!

\string
Pick the right time to jump\\
out of there safely!

\string
You are brave, little one.

\string
And nimble.\code[3,0,10] But your luck\\
shall not last. Abandon hope.

\string
You would fight me?

\string
Very well, then...\\
Marshal your power and...

\string
\size[150]Try to stop me!\size[100]

\string
Chase the Zeekeeper!

\string
It seems as though I have \\
underestimated you...

\string
But neither have I unveiled\\
my true strength!

\string
I can offer you no mercy. \\
I am sorry. It must be so!

\string


\string


\string
Impressive. Yes, very.

\string
You've almost got it!\code[3,0,10]\\
Just hang in there!

\string


\string


\string
Did I not warn you?\\
You are no match for me!

\string
Now! Grab it!

\string
None may hinder me!\\
I shall remain aloft!

\string
The Zeekeeper... Who knew\\
it could cross dimensions?!

\string
We must match its power!

\string
Dreamy Luigi! Stay on the\\
Zeekeeper's tail!

\string
It's about to unleash an\\
attack... I sense this.

\string
You must dodge and then\\
counter by \color[44,101,255,255]ramming\color[0,0,0,255] into it!

\string


\string
You are persistent...

\string
Phew...\code[3,0,10] Slight weariness\\
overcomes me...

\string
The Zeekeeper seems to be\\
slowing a bit!

\string
Catch up with it, and drag\\
it down to earth!

\string


\string


\string


\string
Keep at it! ATTAAAACK!

\string
You have great strength...\code[3,0,10]\\
I concede you are powerful...

\string
But so, too, am I!\code[3,0,15]\\
The battle is not over yet!

\string


\string
\size[150]SCRAAW!\size[100]

\string
OK, it's finishing time,\\
Dreamy Luigi!

\string
Twice you have forced me \\
to tear a dimensional rift...

\string
You are a worthy foe!\code[3,0,10]\\
But now I must end this.

\string
Transforming into a giant...\\
I invented that, pal!

\string
No way some green stache\\
gets to bite MY style!

\string
Bowser, sire!\code[3,0,10] Your loyal\\
minions stand at the ready!

\string
You must defeat Bowser!\\
Save this good world!

\string
Ah, time for my dream to\\

Time to say night-night!

Fight back in kind,\\

The final \color[44,101,255,255]Finishing Bros.\\

Ohhh, sire... \code[3,0,10]Bowser...\code[3,0,15]\\
