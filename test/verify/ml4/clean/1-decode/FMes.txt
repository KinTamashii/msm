We carry both wear and gloves here.
You must have an open slot to equip new apparel!
Please keep that in mind when shopping.
Well then, enjoy your time at Shell Hutch!
Huh? A...pillow?
I only just got here, so I have no idea what's what!
Did you just arrive too? Let's be travel buddies!
Heya, Mar. Can I call you Mar? Did you see that castle?!
It appeared outta nowhere, then the whole island went BA-DUMP!
At first I thought it was some sort of welcome event.
But then I thought, there's no way they do that every day!
Now that all the fuss has died down a bit...
I can resume my vacation! Papa needs a massage!
Did you feel that earthquake? I almost lost my lunch!
The epicenter was somewhere to the east of here!
So many crazy things have happened here...
AH! I forgot to buy a souvenir for my wife!
Mushrise Park is just around the bend.
It's the perfect place for a bean to germinate!
Ahahaha! Those fraidycats ran off like a bunch of cowards!
Oooh... Uh... Well... Yeah. Maybe I oughta go, too!
Just when I thought the drama was over...
Some crazy earthquake hits!
Hmmmm... Maybe I should move to another island...
The wind feels so hoo today!
Did you hoo that loud noise?
It was hoorrible!
I bet that big castle was just some PR hoo.
I mean, hoo would actually believe that hoogwash?
What in the hoo?!
Pretty sure that was a hooquake!
(Psst! Hey! Do you know what that spinning thing is?)
(What? You don't?)
(So you do know! Please, tell me!)
(That's...you know! That...thing, right?)
(Right? I mean... You know what I mean!)
(It's...that thing... That keeps birds away... I think.)
(Whoa! You're really a scholar on the subject!)
(Well, I guess so...)
(Ah, so it's called a bird repeller...)
(Yeah, sure...)
↑Pi'illo Castle ← Wakeport     Somnom Woods → ↓Mushrise Park
    HP and BP fully restored!    
You found hammers!
You found 'em!
Those are my hammers! So that's where they were!
I was looking for 'em foreeeeeeeeeever!
Huh? You want to give 'em back?
Actually, I just ordered a new one...
But don't tell that to Boss Brickle... 
Anyway, you deserve a reward for finding 'em!
You REALLY got hammers!
Use the R Button to change the action icon to the hammer.
Then use the A Button to swing it!
Hammers are pretty useful. 
You can break a rock like this one with a single hit!
Well, as long as you hit it on the cracked side.
Anyway, I've got to get back to work.
Free hammers? Cha-ching!
You can break as many of these rocks as you want.
The more you break, the earlier I can clock off!
Let's give that hammer a swing!
There you go! You still got it! 
These hammers should help us catch that Brickle guy.
You can now use hammers!
Press the R Button to change the icon, then press the A Button to swing.
Yaaaaaawn...
Oh!
Mmm, that was a great nap!
Oh! Hello, boss!
I was just...about to start pulling weeds!
Waaaiiiit... Green guy... Sweet mustache...
These guys are just TOURISTS! Aww, I could've slept longer...
That feather must have hit him on his head.
But this thing is super light... Maybe it hit his weak point.
Oh, come ON! This guy was just slacking off?!
Well I'm glad he wasn't injured...I guess.
We have both feathers now.
Let's put them back where they belong.
I'm always sleepy. Like, all the time.
Did something happen while I was napping?
I can never get enough sleep on this island.
You got the first feather!
You got the second feather!
Let's bring the feathers back to that one guy.
No way!
You found the feathers for me?
Thank you! Now I can fix everything!
OK, here goes...
Boss Brickle! I'm doing it! I'm repairing the feathers!
Mr. Brickle!
Check it out!
I did good!
Can I get a raise?
OK, that did it. Now...
I know you guys have done a lot already...
But could you hit the switch on that machine?
Just give the switch a solid whack with your hammer.
All right. It worked!
Thanks a million! It's good as new!
Soooo... Are you going to throw that switch?
Now where did those feathers get blown off to?
If I can't get this spinning, the fountain won't work!
Think you could throw the switch on that machine for me?
Just smack the switch with your hammer.
Have you seen the rotating yellow feathers in the park?
Those are actually windmills that power our facilities!
Surprisingly, Boss Brickle is really big on green energy.
You guys are the best!
Boss Brickle will have no reason to dock my pay!
Thanks again for the help!
Don't you just love how green and vibrant this park is?!
OH YEAH! Now THAT was a nap!
WHAAAAAAAAAAT?
It didn't look like this when I went to sleep!
Wait...how long was I asleep?!
So I was trapped inside a...pillow?
Thanks for rescuing me. How can I ever repay you?
The only skill I have is flinging things really high!
It's not much, but if you ever need to be flung, let me know.
Hey, what's up! 
Fling me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
I need to chill out... 
Fling me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Go to the dream world? 
No        　
Yes
One of the wind feathers landed on top of this rock.
And I'm supposed to break the rocks into pieces...
But I seem to have misplaced my hammer...
The last time I saw it was when I repaired that bridge...
Hey! Are you using that hammer?
It's just so satisfying to shatter a big ol' boulder!
It's therapeutic, and there are coins in some of them!
I heard that the castle blasted the small islands with lasers!
I wish it would have blasted some of these boulders too.
(Big flowers AND a fountain?! This park is the bestest!)
(Though I wish these trees had sweet fruit.)
(Sometimes I find yummy- looking berries in the bushes.)
(But my tongue isn't long enough to reach them...)
(A weird castle suddenly appeared in the sky!)
(Who did that? How?! Is it a friendly castle?!)
(What was up with that castle in the sky?)
(What if instead of a castle, it was a giant fruit? Ohohoh...)
(That earthquake shook all the trees in the park!)
(If the trees had fruit on them, I'd be in heaven now.)
Exploring new areas is such a rush!
Hey there! How's life?
Just look at those feather- petal things spinning around!
You don't see that sort of thing in the Beanbean Kingdom!
Makes me feel like getting swept up in an adventure!
Hahaha nooooooooo... Not really.
Princess Peach walked by here just a little while ago.
I have to say, pink is TOTALLY her color!
Everything got really dark a little bit ago.
There was some kind of building in the sky!
Now that the castle's gone, people are starting to relax.
Not me though! I'm off to find intrigue and adventure!
That earthquake really shook everybody up.
All of the sunbathers left the beach in a hurry.
Not a bad view, actually!
The feathers fell off and everything stopped!
Maybe putting the feathers back will fix it?
Speaking of feathers, I saw one fall down over there.
Oh, joy! The feathers have been replaced.
But the fountain still isn't working.
There must be one more step to do.
Wow! These wind things are really something special!
I wonder if I can smuggle one back to the Mushroom Kingdom?
This would do wonders for Peach's Castle.
Although it might put the gardeners out of work...
That loud noise earlier really startled me!
I thought all the feathers were going to fall off again!
I should really get out and explore more of the island.
The maintenance team just got done with repairs.
I don't think those feathers will be going anywhere soon.
But then again, neither am I!
Even that earthquake didn't knock the feathers off!
They must have really stuck them on there hard...
What's wrong? Hurry up and take the picture!
I want both feathers aligned in the picture.
But getting the timing right is kind of hard.
Ughh... Staring at those feathers is making me dizzy.
Gah! I can't see anything! My camera's getting wet!
Do I really have to take the picture from here?
If you're looking for anything in the park...
I'd ask the curator, Boss Brickle!
He's probably by the fountain to the south.
Boy... Weird stuff going on... Makes a guy REAL uneasy...
But by gum, as long as even one guest remains, I'll stay!
If ya get lost, check the map on da Touch Screen! -Mushrise Management
WARNING! Incredible, mind-blowin' view ahead! -Mushrise Management
I feel like that flying castle is following me around.
See?! Look over there!
You can see Pi'illo Castle from here!
What a view!
HELLO-O-O!
ECHO-O-O!
SUPER TO-O-OAD!
If only SHE were here...
I think there's a lookout up there on the right.
There are weird things happening on this island.
Oh, well. It's not my island!
These boulders are blocking the way!
You wanna do something about this, guys?
You broke up the rocks blocking the path!
YESSSS! We can get to the lookout now!
That's why they pay you the big bucks!
Really, Mario. You just made my day. Thanks a ton!
I was saving this for an emergency, but you take it.
You got a 1-Up Mushroom!
Just to warn you, the path ahead gets a little...
DANGEROUS!
After the storm, monsters kinda moved in here.
If you're heading south, you'd better be careful!
Hey, you in the green... Are you actually SHAKING?!
Well, maybe you should be. Monsters are no joke.
When I first came to this island, it was so peaceful.
But now there are castles appearing out of thin air.
THIS IS MADNESS!
The guidebook says amazing hoos are just past here...
But that staff member there made it sound hoorific!
I just saw a Toad go in there by himself...
That guy is three times the hoo I am!
Hoo boy. I've been standing here for a while now...
But I just don't have the hoo to keep going!
I think the symbol on this tile is the island's mascot.
Some sorta bird guardian called the Zeekeeper.
Hmmm... Maybe not the best idea to walk on him.
A legendary bird called Zeekeeper is the mascot?
He looks too sleepy to be powerful, if you ask me.
That castle appeared, and now everyone's freaking out!
I wish the Zeekeeper would appear and fix all this!
Where are you, Zeekeeper!
GAH! I've got cracks all over my body!
Being a stone was NOT fun.
Thanks for the help, my mustachioed friends!
How can I help? 
Let's chat 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Antasma!
You turned me into stone!
And made me all crumbly bumbly!
So now I'm all angry flangry!
Did you see it? That creepy castle?
I bet you anything Antasma is behind this!
He's everything that's wrong with the world!
Go to the dream world? 
No         
Yes
You've now rescued all of the Pi'illos!
You have our thanks, Mario and Luigi!
Let us go to Mushrise Park to tell Eldream.
You got Attack Piece number 
 for Mushrise Park!

Noooo! Noooooo!
Somebody!
HELP ME!
You saved me!
I never thought I'd come across monsters here.
Worst vacation ever!
Oh, yeah!
I found this as I was walking in the park.
It's an Attack Piece thingamabobble.
I was just gonna toss it, so why don't you take it?
About those Attack Pieces...
They can be found in blocks like that one over there.
My tour guide told me about them.
He was all like, "Blah, blah, blah..."
"Try to find as many as you can."
He said if you want to find more Attack Pieces...
Just check the guide map on the Touch Screen.
And there was something else...
Right! It was about the map!
Open the menu, please!
Gotta run! Ciao!
I'll let you know if I find another Attack Piece.
The Toad from earlier has the last piece.
Let's ask him!
Looks like you got all the Attack Pieces in this area.
Maybe the last one is a little farther ahead.
Mushrise Park Attraction Slingshroom
1) Using a Slingshroom 
2) How can I go farther?
 Never mind
1) Using a Slingshroom
Hit it with a hammer to compress it.
Stand on it and wait. When the mushroom pops up, you'll fly into the sky!
Try it out. It's a great way to relieve stress!
2) How can I go farther?
Tall Slingshrooms can be hammered multiple times to increase their power. 
The stronger their power, the farther you'll fly.
Don't forget to leave your troubles on the ground!
Ahhhhhhhhh... What a crazy dream!
I dreamt Antasma turned me into a stone pillow!
Wooo... What a relief... It was...just...a...dream...
It WASN'T a dream, was it? Well, that's just disturbing!
Thank you for helping me! Fossilization is not for me!
Such a fine breeze here! 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Before I was imprisoned, this was but a grassy field...
I must have been under for a long, long time...
Go to the dream world? 
No         
Yes
You've now rescued all of the Pi'illos!
You have our thanks, Mario and Luigi!
Let us go to Mushrise Park to tell Eldream.

Mushrise Park Attraction Seesaw Mushrooms
1) Changing the height 
2) Starting over 
3) Different colors 
Never mind
1) Changing the height
Hammer one of the two mushroom caps to raise the height of the other.
Go get your 'saw on!
2) Starting over
The mushrooms will return to their original heights when you touch the ground.
To change heights, just touch the ground and wait!
3) Different colors
Seesaw Mushrooms are always paired with those of the same color.
Other color mushrooms will not be affected.
The Toad from earlier has the last piece.
Let's go!
Looks like you got all the Attack Pieces in this area.
Maybe the last one is up ahead.
It gets real windy here. Hold on ta ya hats! -Mushrise Management
This WOULD be a relaxing park...
If it weren't for all the monsters!
I guess variety is good though.
Gotta keep us on our toes.
They blocked the road over there earlier.
But I heard there are cool attractions there!
They have Slingshrooms AND Seesaw Mushrooms!
When that castle started floating, I ran to the blimport.
All the flights were booked solid though, so I came back.
I guess everyone is trying to get off the island.
The castle should be the last of the craziness though, right?
Floating castles and mega earthquakes?!
Sigh. I guess I might as well embrace it.
I'm going to have some wild vacation memories!
The prettiest spot in the park is just ahead!
There's a huge fountain and gorgeous flowers.
It's really incredible. I'm so glad I came!
Did you see the fountain and flowers? So breathtaking!
I think I'll extend my vacation so I can stare at them more!
Have you seen it? You must have.
That creepy castle in the sky?
It sends a shiver up my spine!
Maybe I should end my vacation early...
OHHHH! What a tragedy!
The fountain. IT'S RUINED!
It's all that castle's fault!
Hoo know, Mushrise Park was once just a muddy field.
But then that Bricky guy transformed it into hoo.
Amazing what a little elbow grease can hoo, isn't it?
Really gotta hoo me some of that elbow grease.
The Dozing Sands desert is still under hoostruction.
The forewoman seems hoo be pretty competent, though.
We've had a lot of visitors from the Mushroom Kingdom.
Even Princess Peach is visiting our little island!
I hope she finds time to visit Mushrise Park.
Princess Peach might come visit our park!
I better make sure it's in good shape!
Prin... Prin... PRINCESS PEACH CAME BY HERE!
I'm her biggest fan! AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Right here! Princess Peach walked right through here!
I'm going to call this Princess Peach Path from now on!
Mr. Brickle told us to just ignore the floating castle.
How do you "just ignore" a floating castle, HUH?!
I think he doesn't want us to scare the visitors away.
Am I crazy? With the whole castle business?
The more time passes, the more unreal it all seems.
Sorry, folks! This gate is out of service.
There are too many monsters on the loose.
Boss Brickle gave me strict lockdown orders.
Please exit via the Pi'illo Castle gate.
There are two areas beyond this gate.
Shall I tell you of them? 
No          
Yes
Past the gate to the right lies Dozing Sands.
It's a sweltering, mysterious desert full of quicksand!
It's also under construction, so watch your step!
Would you like to hear more? 
No          
Yes
Past the gate to the left you'll find Driftwood Shore.
Legend has it that if you fall asleep on the shoreline...
You'll meet a legendary creature in your dreams!
Now that's my idea of a good time!
I see you've been walking around the Dozing Sands.
How'd I know that? Your boots have sand on them!
All right, then. Have a nice trip!
I hear everyone's trying to leave the island.
I don't blame them. That flying castle is terrifying!
Maybe that earthquake was a good thing.
Maybe it means all the monsters left the island.
Maybe I'm in denial...
Storm knocked a tree across the path.
But fear not! The park staff are on it!
Do it, boys! WOO! WOO!
Our apologies, folks! We'll clear this up!
C'mon, guys! Show 'em what Brock staffers can DO!
I'll make sure dis gate stays open from now on, OK?
I'm headin' back hut-ward. Swing by sometime, yeah?
OK. Princess Peach, I think it'll be safer for you back at the castle.
Mario, Luigi... Good luck. I'll leave this to you.
We should be going too!
Hold a moment!
Eldream? Is anything amiss?
Oh no, there is no crisis, my prince.
I just wanted to tell my fellow beard enthusiasts something.
If you stand true and bring more aid to the Pi'illo folk...
I hope you will come see me on occasion.
As a Pi'illo elder, I have gifts I would bequeath to those worthy.
Well spoken, Eldream! You do our people proud!
Eldream speaks truly, and know that I will add some gifts of my own!
As you travel, I hope you will continue to help any Pi'illo folk you find.
You have such strength within you! Use it to help the sleeping stones!
Yes, well, THIS Pi'illo is going to have a nice nap in the administrator's hut.
Oh, I forgot! So far, you've helped a total of 
 Pi'illos!
I suppose that merits some small reward, hmm?
You got a Bare Hammer!
If you can free a total of 7 Pi'illos, I shall give you something else!
Everybody set? Let's go find that Dream Stone.
The Dozing Sands are nearby this park exit.
The bad guys might have already found it. Hurry!
If you have any questions about things in the park...
I'd find the park curator, Boss Brickle!
He's probably up north, by the former fountain.
Hmm...
We moved the tree that was blocking this path.
But now there are a bunch of monsters around!
We really need to get rid of all those rocks though...
Ah, dear guest! May I help you?
Brickle asked you to clear the rocks here?
Well, you certainly look burly enough for the job!
We really appreciate your help.
You got a Mushrise Park shot!
You can assemble it at Kylie Koopa's place in Wakeport!
Bahaha!
Actually made it? Wow, go figure!
You guys must really want dis pillow, huh?
Bah!
BAHA!
Unless you knuckleheads catch me, y'ain't gettin' squat!
BAHAHA!
A'ight, playtime's done.
I really gotta get back to work.
I'll just...uh...
Whuh-oh!
HYUUP!
WIGGLE! IT!
HYUUUURGH! MRRRFFFFF!
If I can...just... GAAAAAH!
My back...
Seriously?!
If he would have just given us the pillow...
Well, no use crying over spilt stardust...
Mario, Luigi—let's see if we can help him.
If we don't, we'll never get Eldream's pillow.
Can you get on top of the fountain?
Let's walk around to try to find a way to help him.
Ready, guys? Quiet please.
Pi'illo Island's climate makes it hard to preserve water.
So we installed an efficient system for the fountain!
Can anyone guess how it works?
I have no idea!
Tell us!
Well...
First, we dug a long tunnel with access from that drainpipe.
We set up a pipe system fed by an underground reservoir.
Finally, an underground pump to feed water to the fountain!
Right! And who did it all? The park manager...
Boss Brickle!
Whoa!
This Boss Brickle must be some kind of genius!
Amazing! Oh, but...
Who is this Boss Brickle?
Aww! It's broken!
That explosion earlier must have ruined it...
Fresh water sources are rare here because of the climate.
So we installed an efficient new system for the fountain!
We use long pipes to pull water from a reservoir.
Then, an underground pump feeds water to the fountain!
Our fountain appears to be...broken today.
So I'm afraid that's the end of the tour!
Can anyone name this plant found all around the park?
These are Thick Mushrooms!
Really? These are mushrooms?
We don't have mushrooms like this back home!
Apparently, Pi'illo Blimport is overrun with people.
I urge our guests to remain on the island and stay calm.
Sure, the castle in the sky is slightly terrifying, but...
Why is everyone leaving?! Maybe we should go too!
AHHH! The flying castle of doom is gonna eat me!
Attention, guests! It's all under control.
Please enjoy your stay here in Mushrise Park!
That castle is still hovering there...staring into my soul.
My boss was right. Going on vacation was a terrible idea.
The people in that castle could be watching us.
There's something really creepy about that...
Everything is under control! That earthquake earlier...
Was just a monster-filled castle crashing to the ground!
The flying monster castle crashed into the ground?!
What's going to happen next on this crazy island?
At least that evil castle is on the ground now.
Never thought I'd say THAT on my vacation.
Here we are! Quiet, please!
This is actually the most popular spot in the park!
Here at the Fountain of the Zeekeeper, our blossoming...
Blossoming? I don't see anything blossoming!
BOOOR-ING!
Well...uh... OHHHHH!
If you'll turn your attention to the top of the fountain!
You'll see the park manager, Boss Brickle...fixing something!
INCREDIBLE!
BRAVO!
What in the world is Boss Brickle doing up there?!
Th-there we go! Check out those blooms, folks!
Wow! This is the best park ever!
That guy stuck in the fountain was a hoot!
I've never seen such plumbing skills back home!
Oh please...
There's a killer castle in the sky! We're all goners!
Evacuate! We have to panic and evacuate!
That castle has got to be some kind of marketing ploy.
These marketing types are getting desperate.
Well, the castle hasn't vaporized us yet... 
So maybe it's friendly? Enjoy your stay!
Ooh! I hope the castle explodes into fireworks!
You guys really know how to put on a show!
Errrrr... Well... We didn't actually plan any of this.
Please! Just do it one more time!
Hey, make that brick guy fly into the air again!
The flowers withered instantly! I was hoorified!
Unless they can turn this around quickly...
My review of this park is two hoos way down!
What a hoo-opener it was when the flowers bloomed!
Could this be one of the park's special events?
My review of this park is five out of five hoos!
They say if hoo fall asleep on Driftwood Shore...
You'll meet a very hoo creature in your dreams!
What the hoo is happening?
It suddenly got so dark!
It was a hoo or two scarier than the exploding fountain!
I've decided not hoo be surprised anymore...
There's just hoo much hoopla to keep track of!
There's something off about that Yoshi there.
He's been eyeballing the place for a while now...
He'd better not be thinking about what I think he is!
I'm keeping an eye on him in case he tries anything!
Look at him! Just standing there in the midst of chaos!
What evil plans are brewing inside his naughty head?!
Yeah, about that Yoshi... I've been thinking...
Maybe...he's just really into that fruit.
(Ooh! That fruit looks yummy.)
(And that purple one looks delicious too.)
(They'd probably be mad if I ate it though.)
(I mean, that guy over there is glaring at me!)
(Ohoho... That fruit looks sooo good.)
(But that guy is still staring at me!)
(That castle showed up and everyone's panicking.)
(Now if only that dude would leave!)
(I could just flick my tongue out real quick.)
(But that park guy hasn't even blinked!)
I always have to water all the hoo in the garden.
She bosses me around and makes me hoo all the work.
But she's the love of my life. Plus I'm terrified of her...
That's hoo-mazing! An automatic sprinkler!
If we had one of those, our yard would be hoo-credible!
It would be even prettier than this hoo-tastic park!
I want an autowaterer like that one, hooney dearest!
You'll make one when we get home...won't hoo?
Yes, but... I'm not sure I can, hoo-bear!
The sprinkler is powered by those feather hoomills.
Our garden isn't windy enough for hoo, muffin!
HONEY! Don't hoo me!
Make the wind yourself if hoo have to!
That's not wind power. That's ME power, you hoo!
I mean... Yes, sweetums! Anything for hoo!
HUH?!
My...rumpus room!
What's bumpin'...da rump?!
DAT AIN'T OK!
Ow... Ow ow ow ow...
Da...symbol of da park. Da Zeekeeper fountain.
Yeah...it kinda exploded.
At least you're not...hurt!
Buhhhh... Whyyyyy?
All my work, gone! GONE!
BAHAHAHA!
He got over that rather quickly...
Yeah, thing is, I already made a new waterin' machine.
I was gonna scrap dat fountain soon anyway!
Whatever. Will you give us that pillow now?!
Hmmm...
Whaddaya need it for?
That's not just any old pillow.
It's Eldream, one of the elders of the Pi'illo Tribe!
No WAY! Eldream the Pi'illo?!
...Who dat?
Aw, whatever.
I'll letcha use dat old pillow in da maintenance hut.
And I got somethin' for ya. For helpin' ol' Brickle out!
You got 10 Attack Pieces!
Now you have all the Attack Pieces for this area...
And that means you've unlocked a brand-new Bros. Attack!
Th-thank you!
Don't mention it. As for dis pillow...
The maintenance hut's just ahead.
Da pillow'll be in dere.
I think this might just work, guys!
Hmm... What's a fella ta do?
Got it!
I'll ask dose guys! Yeah, dat's it!
But wait a tick... Where ARE dem guys?
Hmm...
BUH!
It's you guys!
Good timin'.
I got a little favor ta ask.
Sorry, but we're busy looking for something.
Aww, you guys are always lookin' for somethin'!
Whaddaya got in mind dis time, huh?
The Mushrise Tree Board, eh?
You wanna know if I've seen it round dis park?
BAHAHAHA!
You know who you're talkin' to, buddy?
Come on! I know dis park like da back of my hand!
So you DO know about it! Where is it?!
BAHAHA! I'll tell ya...
Just as soon as ya do me my favor!
So we gotta deal, or what?
Oh boy...
Mario, Luigi— what do you think?
Dat's what I'm talkin' about! Let's get ta work!
Huh... Work?!
Here's what I want ya ta do! You ready?
ROCK CLEARIN'!
Isn't that what you pay your staff for?
Well, a buncha monsters showed up same time dat castle did.
My boys ain't...eh...equipped ta deal with stuff like dat.
I see...
Take a look at dat map, and I'll explain it to ya!
Go break the rocks round the places I showed ya.
Don't matta where ya start workin' from...
But it's prolly easier ta start in da south end.
I'll be waitin' right here!
Talk ta me when ya done.
You forget where ta go, or what? 
No          
Yes
Ya know, back when I was in my teens...
I coulda taken care of dem monsters myself!
Yep, glory days, right? Well, clear dem rocks!
Buh!
You guys got good news for me?
Tell me you went an' broke all of dem rocks.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!
I knew you guys had it in ya!
A deal's a deal. Follow me...
Come on, fellas!
Yes! YESSSSS! I'm ME again!
Are you the ones who saved me?
I have no idea how I can thank you!
I won't forget this for at LEAST a year!
Oh, hello! 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
If you go around and save my friends, too...
Then maybe the Pi'illos won't really go extinct!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
All of the Pi'illo folk have now been freed.
My deepest thanks, Mario and Luigi!
Let's go to Mushrise Park and tell Eldream.
Phew! That's the last of the rocks.
Let's go tell Brickle that we're done!
Then he'll give us the Mushrise Tree Board!
Sorry, but I can't allow you to go beyond this point!
There are boulders and nasty monsters all over...
But please! Enjoy the rest of the park!
Eh? Boss Brickle sent you here?
You came here to help us clear off the rocks?
Well, that's fantastic! Be careful out there!
Boss Brickle works the staff pretty darn hard...
But he's got a heart of gold. ...I think. Maybe.
Phew! That's the last of the rocks.
Let's go tell Brickle that we're done!
Then he'll give us the Mushrise Tree Board!
Phew! That's the last of the rocks.
Let's go tell Brickle that we're done!
Then he'll give us the Mushrise Tree Board!
NOOOOO!
BOSS BRICKLE!
YOU ALIVE?!
Whatever's happening, it doesn't sound good!
I hope everyone's OK.
Let's make sure we're ready before we go.
Grobot, no! Bad robot! Cut it out! Stop! Abort!
Boss Brickle!
I need a raise!
Don't give up!
Boss Brickle!
You OK?
Boss Brickle!
LIVE, dangit!
Can I have next weekend off?
YAARGH!
IT'S ON DA FRITZ!
My Grobot is outta control!
We...had to destroy it. It was the only way.
Oh no... No...
My Grobot... What've dey done to ya, pal?
Yeah...
One of da fountain pieces musta hit 'im.
Short-circuited his polite processor.
Dis is all my fault...
Sorry, guys. Take dis for da trouble.
And you can use my bed whenever ya want.
Just wash dem sheets every now and den.
You got Eldream's Pillow!
That was quick. He's already asleep!
That smell. It smells of lost dreams...
There is no doubt... This is Eldream's pillow!
Mario!
Get in there and find Eldream!
Ask him about the deepest part of the dream world.
You haven't found Princess Peach yet?
I see... You're just taking a breather.
My hearing isn't so good in my left ear.
Please talk to me from the other side, sonny.
Can I help you, sonny? 
Rescued Pi'illos 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
What's next? 
Let's chat 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
This place has changed much...
But the wind feels as refreshing as ever.
If you want to go back to the dream world, let me know!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
The Pi'illos you've rescued? Let's see...
You two have saved 
 Pi'illos so far!
If you see any other Pi'illos around, please help them!
If you can save 
 Pi'illos total, I'll give you a gift.
As for the whereabouts of the trapped Pi'illos...
Just open Pi'illos in the collection menu.
Oh, you've already saved that many?
I was saving this until you'd helped 
 Pi'illos!
What's that? Can this be?
You've now rescued all of the imprisoned Pi'illos!
I knew you wouldn't rest until you saved us all.
Mario. Luigi. You have my eternal gratitude, friends.
You've earned a permanent place among our people!
Eldream, we must reward these brave heroes!
Leave it to me, my prince.
However...
There are too many eyes here...
Please, follow me!
The Pi'illos have all been saved, but our world is still in danger.
Antasma! And this...Bowser. He sounds just as evil!
You two are our only hope of returning peace to this land!
You got a Birthday Hammer!
You got POW Gloves!
You got a Birthday Ring!
You got Golden Wear!
You got POW Gloves DX!
Huh... Wicked tough, tryin' ta noodle up a new park attraction...
But gotta please dem visitors! I gotta thinka SOMETHIN'!
Maybe like a cute li'l animal mascot or somethin'?
Weird. Some old coot sleepin' in my bed...
Dis guy da famous Pi'illo dude, Eldream?
Where do I sleep now? On him? Dat ain't right.
I guess some freaky castle popped up overhead...
What's DAT all about, huh? Craziness, dat's what!
I'm gonna hafta pull OT ta protect da parkgoers!
Those wind-powered generators and the auto-watering system...
You know Boss Brickle conceived of and built them all?
He's not just a crazy old dude!
Thanks for helping Boss Brickle!
Here on Pi'illo Island, no matter what goes down...
If Boss Brickle stands firm, then we stand with him!
Say... If Brickle heard me say that, would I get a raise?
This is the administrator's hut for Mushrise Park.
Administrators do, like, administration and stuff.
I don't know why people are being so cavalier about this...
A FLYING CASTLE just VAPORIZED three ISLANDS!
Boss Brickle lives in the administrator's hut.
After all, he works on the park from dawn until dusk...
Sleeping in this little hut night after night...
Boss Brickle says it's the best part of each day!
He is the MAN!
Going home to a warm meal and my own bed is what makes me happy!
Did that weird castle really attack the barrier islands?!
Man! If Grobot were around, he'd teach it a lesson!
When that castle appeared, all the tourists flipped out.
But the brave park staff kept cool the whole time!
"I want to make dis a park filled with happy visitors!"
...I must hear Boss Brickle say that 20 times a day.
What if we sold little souvenirs with Mushrise Park themes?
We could make key chains and T-shirts with Boss Brickle on 'em!
Then again, I don't think I would buy one of those...
I guess our souvenirs should really be something found nowhere else.
Sounds like some scary stuff going on up in the sky...
Scary as getting yelled at by Boss Brickle? I think not.
If I had to describe Boss Brickle in one word, it would be "unique."
Yeah...tactful. Anyway, can't argue with his love for the park!
Oh, visitors! I'm terribly sorry!
I'm afraid only park staff are allowed past this point.
We store fairly important items back here, you see...
Very boring. Honest. You'll find better sights elsewhere!
Even if the whole island is in an uproar...
My job is to stand here and HOLD! THE! LINE!
Buh!
Dis way!
I'll take it from here!
Yes, sir!
Da treasure's dis way! I'll go first and wait for ya!
Dis music stinks. So why am I sl—
You got Attack Piece number 
 for Mushrise Park!
Now you have all the Attack Pieces for this area...
And that means you've unlocked a brand-new Bros. Attack!
Whoa there...
This looks dicey...
Oh, visitors!
Can I help you?
You're looking for Boss Brickle?
He came by here a little while ago.
Unfortunately there are monsters up ahead.
It would be a liability to let you through.
Ha! These two eat monsters for breakfast!
Well, not literally...
Wait... DO YOU?!
Never mind that... Let's find those pieces!
Great jump!
You know your way around a hammer!
Uh, yeah... No way. I can't let you through.
Mario! Luigi!
Thanks for helping me out of that jam earlier!
I guess this is where the party's at.
...Oh, I get it! In that case...
You should get some more of those Attack Pieces!
How about searching for them? Sound like a plan?
I actually found another one, myself.
I always knew I was talented!
I'm not your average Toad!
Now, hold on...
I remember my tour guide saying something else...
"There are 10 Attack Pieces in every set."
"Find them all to learn a powerful new move!"
He called that move a... Bros. Attack!
I mean, if you guys have some power moves, this guy oughta bend a bit.
Whoa, yeah, that'd change everything! A Bros. Attack!
I'd definitely let you through if you could pull that off.
All these monsters showed up after the storm hit.
And for every one you see, there are 30 more hiding!
Sirs! Excuse me, but I need you to get back from there.
Unless you're some kinda martial-arts master... 
You cannot pass!
Mario has 
 of the Attack Pieces.
I didn't see any over that way...
So you might want to search the other way.
Come back here once you've found 9.
Then, I'll give you the Attack Piece I've got.
Hurry up! I'm dying to see that special move!
Hi, Mario. Found any Attack Pieces yet?
You already have 9 of them?! Sweet!
Here's the one I was holding on to!
We already have 9 Attack Pieces!
Woo-hoo!
Now you can use the Bros. Attack!
I'd like to see that attack in action!
Yeah, let's give it a try! Open the menu screen.
With this new Bros. Attack, nothing can stop us!
If you see any more Attack Pieces around, pick them up!
BYAACK!
Great timing!
This is your chance to use a Bros. Attack!
Let's roll out!
We've gotta get Eldream's pillow from that park guy.
↑ Mushrise Park ← Driftwood Shore      Dozing Sands →
You smell that? Smells like fish! It's either the sea or I need a bath...
Just look at Bowser's castle floating up there like...like...an ugly cloud!
Good thing you're dealing with it so I don't have to. But I totally could.
Yeah, I'm pretty tough. At least as tough as Luigi.
Did you notice that Bowser's castle is gone? I must have scared him off.
Oh... You guys may have helped a little too.
This here? This is the way to Dozing Sands.
But the road's under construction, so watch yer step, capisce?
Don't say I didn't warn you after you twist your ankle or somethin'.
Hey, what's the big idea? What's up with that castle?
How is it just floatin' there like that? 
I heard Britta started a new job.
But it doesn't seem like it's going well.
She's near that really big wall. Keep going right. You can't miss it.
'Member where you defeated that big horned guy? It's east of that.
Welcome, potential customer!
Allow me to give you a quick tour of my shop!
We sell all three types of defensive apparel.
That's wear, gloves, and accessories.
We're the one-stop shop for your defensive needs!
You can equip one piece of gear per apparel slot.
So make sure you have an open slot before you buy.
Got coins to spend? 
Items

Anything else? 
Items 
Gear 
Pi'i-latte      
Never mind
That'll be 10 coins. OK? 
No          
Yes
You...uh...don't have enough coins.
    HP and BP fully restored!    
Now taking applications for the Mount Pajamaja tour!
Visit us in Wakeport!
Accepting climbers of all skill levels!
Mount Pajamaja climbing tour? Do we need to register for it?
Oh, you folks are interested in the climbing tour?
Yes, only registered climbers are allowed on Mount Pajamaja.
You can register for the tour at the tour center in Wakeport!
I hope you can join us!
Tour... center?
What sort of thing is that?
Sounds like joining a tour is the only way to climb Mount Pajamaja.
Things have changed since I've been gone.
The tour center in Wakeport, right?
Let's head over there!
You can get to Wakeport by heading west from Mushrise Park.
Now, let me give you something for all your Pi'illo rescuing!
This is the greatest reward I can offer!
YOOO-HOOO!
ZEEEEEEEEK!
Wise Eldream...
What...was that?
GOOD OLD ELDAWG!
Who on earth?!
Aha! He's here!
Zee...
The Zeekeeper!
Old buddy, it's been forever!
Whatcha need?
Zeek, it's been an age and a half! You're looking trim.
Anyway, I called with some excellent news...
These two brothers have just saved all the Pi'illo folk!
Totally awesome news.
Yes, it certainly is, Zeek. Anyway, they deserve a great reward!
I was thinking maybe you might help them out in battle?
Since you ask, Eldawg...
Sign me up.
Though I AM busy.
It IS sort of a hassle.
But I'm in.
To summon the Zeekeeper, use these!
You got 10 Attack Pieces from Eldream!
You can perform a new Bros. Attack!
So... I must ask, Eldream...
What's the deal with you two?
What, me and Zeek? Just old buddies!
We're tea-drinking pals from way back...
AHAHAHA!
You mean... You and the Zeekeeper hang out?!
Eldream, I am impressed! You're like a celebrity!
Hohohoho!
OK, ready?
Dis is what you been lookin' for...
Da Mushrise Tree Board!
This...is the Mushrise Tree Board?
Well...uh...yeah. Of course! I think...
YOU DON'T KNOW?!
You made us do all that manual labor...
And you didn't know if it was the Mushrise Tree Board?!
Hey now! How was I s'posed ta know?!
Oh, sure. Convenient.
Back when dis park was still a big muddy field...
I found dis thing while I was tillin' da soil.
Yup, my life hadn't been goin' so hot back den...
I came to dis island to get a fresh start, y'know?
I thought maybe if I made da park nice, SHE'D return...
Anyhoo... Dat was round da time I found dat board.
Don't look like no ordinary board, do it?
Nah, dere's definitely somethin' special 'bout it.
...I think.
Allow me to take a look!
Hmm...
The rich texture... This unique luster...
This elegant shape...
There's no doubt about it...
The Mushrise Tree Board!
Phew!
Ha! I knew it!
Now dat we're square, I gotta get back ta work.
Thank you, Mr. Brickle.
You got the Mushrise Tree Board!
The Mushrise Tree Board looks kind of...weird.
Dreambert, did that board really come from a tree?
Yes. The legendary Mushrise Tree grows in this area.
This board is the only thing left after the tree decays.
The tree turns into a board when it dies? Incredible!
I hate to say it, but Brickle really came through for us.
True. Now, let's find the other parts of the bed.
We can look at the menu for info about the remaining parts!
This is the last part we need. We now have them all!
Now we just need to find the master bed crafter in Wakeport.
He's the only one who can assemble the five parts!
The master bed crafter... Yes, I remember now!
If memory serves, his name is Bedsmith.
He may be trapped in a nightmare chunk.
Or he may be in the last place we expect him to be.
We'll need to search high and low to find him.

Oh... You just hopped up on there, huh?  
Uhhh... OK. You may wanna hang on.
Hey!
You, uh... You see those red and green buttons?
If you...like...hammer 'em, you'll activate the drills.
You, uh... You're pretty good at this, bro.
Green dude, you...uh... You can do the same thing on your side.
Whoa... You're, like, pretty good too, bro!
Once the drill retracts, the Drilldigger will keep on truckin'.
OK, WAIT!
You see this long, thin switch thingie? That's a station, man.
If you wanna get off this thing, you gotta drill the station.
Yeah, kinda crazy design, but it's the only way to stop it...
You can also use the drill to break rocks.
And sometimes there's, uh, stuff under the rocks.
I'm basically, like, a pro at making it drill stuff.
Uhh... About the Drilldigger thing. You, uh, gotta ask before you use it.
It's, like, a super-dangerous liability and junk. You know?
It took me years just to learn how to make it drill stuff...
But you guys... You guys learned how to drill right away.
And...you might even be better than me. How cool...for you.
How is that, like, even possible, man?
Oh, man, maybe this is all a dream... Yeah...
I'm the best driller... Yeah. THE BEST! Ahahahaha!
Ahahahahahaha! AHAHAHAHA!
Uhh... OK, now I KNOW that I'm dreaming.
There's a castle floating in the sky over there, man!
Castles don't even have wings, man!
How much longer is this dream gonna go on, man?
Brain, bro. Why you gotta make me dream about work?
Why can't I dream about, like, a house made of ice cream?

Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
How can I help? 
I need info 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
You two set me free? Many thanks, friends!
I know you just awoke, but I must ask you something.
Prince Dreambert!
We need to find the Dream Stone before it falls into the wrong hands.
It must be somewhere in this desert. Do you have any idea where it is?
The Dream Stone? It lies well beyond that sand flow over there.
Here, you'll be needing this.
You got a Dozite!
Uh, impressive...
Heh. You'll need more than one Dozite to find the Dream Stone.
You'll need to find the other gatekeepers, as well.
They've likely been trapped in the dream world as I was.
If you can rescue them, I'm sure they would support your cause.
Thank you, friend.
All right, Mario and Luigi. Onward!
I must warn you: there are a number of monsters in the desert. Be careful.
Castles in the sky... What is this world coming to?
This must have something to do with the Dream Stone.
The misuse of the Dream Stone cannot be tolerated.
Those who would use it for their own ends must be punished.
However, as I am a pacifist, I need a champion.
Will you be the hand of justice that slaps the face of greed?
Days without a sand-flow accident: 001
Report sand mishaps or YOU'RE FIRED! Britta
Waaaaaahhhh!
No! Oh man. Man, oh man! I fell down the sand flow!
Bwahahaha! Hahaha! You're in for it now!
Britta's gonna have your shell for this!
Noooooo! I've gotta get back up there!
You can't. There's no way to climb up that sand flow.
Unless you had a scaffold... which you don't! Hahaha!
Oh man. When Britta finds out... Gulp.
There's just no way to climb up that sand flow.
If only I had some magic stairs or something...
D-did you see that? Those magic stair things just kind of...appeared!
UFO! IN THE SKY! ALIEN ABDUCTION!
I should get back to work before Britta fires me again.
I'll climb back up that sand flow if it's the last thing I do!
Hey! You guys made it up here! You guys are amazing! HEE HEE!
Listen, do us a favor and don't tell Britta my boy took a tumble...
Castle technology sure has come a long way.
I never thought I'd see a floating castle in my lifetime!
I've barely done any work today. Hahahahaha!
I guess I shouldn't be laughing about it, but... Hahahahaha!
Whoa!
Stay still!
Thanks for the hand, guys!
Hey, uh...
I noticed you guys have hammers.
Let's hook 'em up!
You really helped us out, so...
In return, we'll show you a special technique!
Ready? I saw this in a movie once.
Whoa! It worked!
You can hit the red guy with your hammer to send him underground!
And if that isn't cool enough, he can also move around underground!
You can go under fences and other objects with this technique!
Why don't you give it a shot?
It doesn't hurt... very much.
Just press the R Button to change the action icon to the hammer!
Then press the B Button to give him a whack with the hammer! 
Solid whack, green man!
Red guy, you can move around with the Circle Pad!
Just hit the A Button to pop back out!
You learned the Mole Mario Bros. Move!
Use the R Button to change the action icon to the hammer, and then press the B Button!
Oh, before I forget! There's one more thing you can do with that hammer!
Just do the same thing as before but on a hard surface.
Check it! Instead of going underground, you'll get squashed like this!
You could probably use this technique to go through small holes.
Just smack him with the hammer again to return him to normal size.
It's your turn now. Put your back into it!
Yup, you're on a hard surface where you can't go underground...
Now press the R Button to switch the action icon to the hammer!
Now press the B Button to swing the hammer! 
That's it! Good work.
OK, now press the B Button to whack him back to normal!
You learned the Mini-Mario Bros. Move!
Mario shrinks if you hit him with the hammer on a hard surface!
Whaddaya say we test these new moves you just learned?
Go hit that block over there.
And while you're at it, that one over there too.
We excavated those blocks earlier today, but you can have 'em.
Really, we insist. You helped us out, so you earned 'em.
Oh yeah, nice block busting!
Let's wrap this thing up. Bring it in, you two.
OK, one last thing...
Go underground, and come back up when you're right underneath this beanhole.
Yup, that's a bean, all right.
Take it from me: beans are where it's at. They increase your stats.
Sure, one bean won't make THAT big a difference...
But they really add up. Before you know it, you'll be a powerhouse!
People say you can find beanholes all over the island.
So anytime you see one, get your bean on!
Check Collection in the menu to see the beans you've found.
This will really come in handy, so don't forget!
Huh?!
What's that?
Hey, hey! What's the big idea?
Go on and hit those blocks! We still have one last thing to teach you!
Get over here, will ya? We're almost done talking. Promise!
Right here! Get a load of this beanhole!
You enjoying your new moves?
Going under the sand is a good way to cool off, huh?
You know anything about that castle up in the sky?
Looks like an ominous storm cloud made of stone.
I haven't seen that sky castle in a while.
Maybe it was just a really overfed bird.
It's so hot out here! I need a break.
Don't tell Britta I said that.
Castles in the sky?
What's next? Clouds on the ground?!
Well, I guess that's called fog...
I'll keep working until the world falls apart!
Oh, I thought you were Britta.

No          
Yes
Oh boy, oh boy... Hey! 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Oh boy, oh boy... I'm finally back!
Didn't think I'd make it outta there!
Oh boy, oh boy. Thanks a bunch!
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! What's that?!
A castle?! A floating castle!
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!
Oh boy... That castle gives me the willies.
I bet you there's a horned monster controlling it.
The horns are how you know they're evil.
Oh boy! This place is out of control!
I feel like I should try to help somehow.
But then I'm like, "Nah..."
All the Pi'illo Folk have been saved!
We are in your debt, Mario and Luigi!
Let's go to Mushrise Park and inform Eldream!
STOP!
This is important, so listen up.
Your job is to break as many rocks as you can.
Obviously there are rocks EVERYWHERE.
And they're in the way. So get RID OF 'EM!
All you gotta do is hit 'em with the drill.
Get ready.
Whaddaya doin'?! We ain't done here!
That's enough!
OK, how many rocks did you break? 
?
Wouldya look at that. You broke all the rocks!
Didn't think ya had it in ya, bub.
You slacked off a little, but you ain't fired. Not yet.
You mean to tell me...you couldn't break a single rock?
WAHAHAHA!
That ain't funny.
Shame on you.
You chumps better practice, or you're fired!
Anyway, the gist is, you ride the track and break the rocks.
Now, you see that Drilldigger Panel?
You'll see one of them panels wherever the track splits.
The arrows point in the directions the track runs.
Flip the panel over to change directions.
Flippin' the panel over takes some elbow grease.
You know how to go underground, right?
You just gotta get up under there and flip it.
But let's skip that panel for now.
You can take care of the rest of the rocks later.

Oh, yeah—some of the rocks have stuff under 'em.
There's even chatter about people findin' stone pillows or somethin'.
Hold it, bub!
I changed my mind about lettin' you hang around my job site.
If you're gonna be on the site, I'm gonna put you to work.
C'mere!
What's the delay? Shake a leg!
Don't worry, there's a paycheck in it!
Ready? Good.
Hang on to somethin'. I'm not stoppin' if you fall off.
And we're back.
Oh, yeah. This block here is important.
That's how you call the Drilldigger.
Just hit the block to call it over.
OK, class is over. GET TO WORK!
Your job is to break the rocks lyin' around the desert.
The more rocks you break, the more dough you make.
Simple enough for ya?
Let's finish up this lesson by breakin' this one here.
Hang on... Is that... Is that a pillow?
Mario! Luigi! Look at that!
Let's use it to go to the dream world!
Hey! Whaddaya think you're doin', slacker?!

Granny?! Why I oughta...
You oughta go get yourself a makeover.

Now you have all the Attack Pieces for this area...
And that means you've unlocked a brand-new Bros. Attack!
We're right below the park now.
Which means...
The fountain's water source is here!
This machine must pump the water up.
And then it sprays out of the fountain.
Maybe we can boost the pump's power.
Pump up the water pressure, y'know?
With more pressure...
We might be able to dislodge Boss Brickle.

What can I do for you? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Well, it seems I was petrified for many a day and night.
I offer you folks my thanks for the rescue!
Ah, so you seek the Dream Stone, huh?
One of the gatekeepers near here might know...
So that Antasma has been revived...
He caused much anguish long ago.
But all that is past. Long past...
Pi'illo Island was once unmatched in beauty!
Everywhere the eye fell, it fell upon a flower.
But all that is past. Long past...
I was in love with someone once, way back when.
Those eyes... That voice... That fluffy embrace...
But all that is past... Long past...
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
My assistance is yours, child. 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Freedom embraces me... My thanks are yours, child.
In return, I will bestow upon you that which you seek.
May the Zeekeeper light your way.
You got a Dozite!
One other like me is still in need. Do what you must.
Two more like me are still in need. Go to them.
Befriend your senses, child.
A brutal monstrosity wanders the sands.
A being so terrible, the sun refuses to shine upon it.
I felt it as I floated in the void of the dream.
May safety be your companion.
The gatekeepers celebrate their freedom. Be thanked.
That castle up there is an insult to our people.
To misuse the Dream Stone is unforgivable.
A fool with power only fools himself.
The Dream Stone must be recovered.
If it is not, this island is doomed.
May the Zeekeeper watch over us all.
Justice is served in small portions.
But enough portions yield a full belly.
All the Pi'illo Folk have been saved!
We are in your debt, Mario and Luigi!
Let's go to Mushrise Park and inform Eldream!
Hey! Listen up, guys!
A large horned creature has been reported in this area!
If you see it, alert your supervisor!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
SUPERVISOOOOR!
That... That was CRAZY! What was that?!
That explains the strange vibes I felt in the dream!
That's not something you see every day.
You guys the new guys? Yeah, you are. Look at you.
Then you probably don't know about this red panel here, huh?
Drive on it, and the machine will be all like, "VROOOOM!"
It'll go superfast and launch into the air if you hit a bump!
SOOOOO awesome!
But you gotta flip the panel over first, got it?
Dude! I saw you guys go all superfast like "VREEEEEEOW!"
Coolest thing in the history of forever times two, right?!
That castle is HUUUUUUUGE!
Isn't it crazy that we're so small?
We're living in some CRAAAAZY times!
But it's guys like us that keep the world turning.
You got a Dozing Sands shot!
You can decrypt it at Kylie Koopa's place in Wakeport!
Welcome to the island!
Pi'illoooo! Yaaaay!
Glad you came!
Our island is your island!
I have excitement!
Hey hey!
Move along. Pi'illo Castle ahead.
A GUEST!
A visitor! Party time!
Warm, warm welcome!
So much to see! So much to do!
Noble guest! May fun find thee!
By gum, this island is just plain great!
New guy! New stache!
Can I get a woo-hoooo?!
Glad you're here!
Warm, warm welcome!
I heard Princess Peach passed through here a little while ago.
THE Princess Peach! Man! Can't believe I missed seeing her.
What's going on?! Look at that castle!
The neighboring islands are exploding or something, the blimport is closed...
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?!
I had a real hoo in my hamper about seeing some of the far-off sights!
But nooo, my brother keeps hooing about how we're fine staying here...
Talk about an overprotective hoo-hatcher!
What in the hoobity?! We can't get to the blimport!
How're we gonna get the hoo outta here?!
What the hoo was that hullabaloo?
At least now it's quiet as a mouse on Hooday.
This area seems safe, don't hoo think?
Yup. All the sightseeing we need right hoo!
Hoo mama! Some crazy castle's up in the sky!
So what kind of hoo-nut closes the blimport?!
You should've seen how hard people were losing their hoo just now!
Not us Hooskis, of course. We hoo in the face of danger.
Hey, Mr. Mario! Got any sightseeing spots you can recommend?
Huh? Pi'illo Castle, you say?
So you're telling me there's a castle on Pi'illo Island, eh? Intriguing!
Thank you! I'll be sure to check it out later!
I'll definitely go check out Pi'illo Castle later! For real!
Ah! Mr. Mario! Mr. Luigi!
Everyone's freaking out since a castle appeared in the sky...
DO SOMETHING, GUYS!
Well... Looks like everyone chilled out and the blimport reopened.
I don't want to alarm you, but did you hear that crazy-loud noise a while back?
What in the world could that have been?
Well, hello there!
Welcome to Pi'illo Island!
Dearest guests!
Regrettably, there are, well, some monsters to the north.
Terribly sorry about that. Be careful if you head there.
Hang on a sec... Yeah! I know you guests...
You guys arrived with Princess Peach earlier?
Ohhhh man! She's...swell. I mean, the swellingest!
The moment I saw her, I was a huge fan!
Ahh... Princess Peach... So very swell...
Ahh man...
As a tenured staff member, I'm ashamed to admit this...
In the middle of all that commotion earlier, I ran.
Princess Peach probably lost all respect for me...
There was a huge earthquake earlier!
But listen: I didn't flee in terror this time!
I stayed! I led guests to safety! I RULE!
NOPE!
Sorry, the blimport is a complete mess, what with everyone trying to get in there.
Unfortunately, that means we have to block the way there from this spot.
Thanks for understanding.

Welcome!
This place will soothe all of your ills!
Nice seeing you!
There are endless sights here on the island!
We've been waiting for you!
Please enjoy Pi'illo Island!
Pi'illo Castle Entry This Way
Mario! Luigi!
Many vistas await your eyes here on Pi'illo Island!
Find them all, and gaze to your heart's content!
Now, what's hot with the tourists right now...
Ah! Mushrise Park is always popular. It's just to the south.
Huh? Someone in a hurry? I don't know about a hurry...
But boy, I did see someone moving REALLY fast!
Yeah, he headed south toward Mushrise Park.
Someone was just HAULING south toward Mushrise Park...
No idea what lit a fire under that guy, but he could MOVE.
We recommend slowly strolling while enjoying Pi'illo Island.
Huh? Why? Why would we recommend strolling?
Well, I'll tell you. Someone sprinted south just now...
And it discombobulated the guests a bit!
WAAH!
WHOOAA!
BAD! BAD THING!
Some terror castle appeared and zapped the surrounding islands!
Help...
HAALP!
We should bail! It's too dangerous!
It appears Antasma and Bowser have put their plan into motion!
We need to make tracks to Driftwood Shore so we can find Princess Peach!
She might be their next target!
I sense we will find Eldream somewhere in this dream world.
I am almost certain that he is trapped in a nightmare chunk.
There! The thing that bunny is holding... Could it be?!
Eldream must be inside that chunk!
After that rabbit!
Yo... You guys need somethin' or somethin'?
Da name's Brickle. I run dis park.
Huh? We already met somewheres?
Naw, you're nuts! Ain't never seen you.
Anyway, hope you dig spendin' time here.
I love dis place, y'know? And you can see why!
Can't believe we still got trouble attractin' visitors!
Gotta be somethin' special, yeah... Somethin' dynamic...
Add a little pizzazz to da place, yeah... Somethin'.
Luigi has met him in the real world.
But this form... It is not one with reality.
I sense he was created by Luigi's subconscious.
But let's not dwell on that. We have a bunny to catch!
Eh? What's going on here?
Would you look at that?! I can move! And talk!
Could this... Were you the ones who saved me?
Thank you. I had just about given up on your generation!
Eh?! Peach has been kidnapped? I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
What?! She was taken underground somehow?
Oh dear... She's probably down in Dream's Deep.
Dream's Deep is, ah... Well, it's...
You kids REALLY want to save Peach, huh?
OK, then. I may not look it, but I'm an elder of the Pi'illo Tribe!
I've been around the block a time or two, so I'll help you out.
You boys saved my life! No need to thank me.
Fluffykins! Come to papa!
Oh, how I've missed you, my little flufferbunny!
You're such a good boy! Who's daddy's good boy?
Ahem... This is Dreambunny.
He's always there in a pinch!
All right, fluffykins! You know what to do!
Hoyaa!
HIYAAAA!
Yep! I just opened a path to Dream's Deep!
That's about the limit for this old boy.
Hope this helps a bit!
Is that right? Glad I could help.
OK, then. Jump into this light and rescue your princess!
And now, Mr. Flufferbuns!
I've got a cuddle session with your name on it!
Huh! Bunny?!
Uh... Welcome to Brickle...Mart.
I opened a new shop ta raise funds for Mushrise Park.
Wanna buy somethin'? 
Items 
Gear 
Pi'i-latte         
Never mind
That's 10 coins, yeah? 
No          
Yes

You know, this island was hit by a big storm the other day.
The town didn't get damaged as much as the park near here...
But we're still trying to move the fallen trees out of the way!
Yo-heave-HO!
Hey! Hey! HO!
Can we go in now? No? Not yet?
Aww, I NEED to go in there and shop!
Wakeport's the hootest island spot, and it is RIGHT THERE!
They still have some hootel rooms available, too!
Palm-tree removal was under hoo until just a few minutes ago.
But it's all hooed up now! The way into town is open!
Something just scared my hoo off!
A flying hoo castle! Flash! Blam! Hoo!
I don't like this hoo of a town anymore!
That castle put a hoo in my hairnet!
In this town, any hoo can happen!
Hi there, kids! You can't go through this area now!
But there's still PLENTY of fun island stuff to do!
Go check out another area until we finish cleaning up!
Hey, kids! Glad you came! Past here is Wakeport!
Careful not to get lost in there, mm-kay?
Hey, kids! Glad you're here! I hope you're not hurt!
I'll take care of that castle, so no need to worry!
That other Zeekeeper treats everyone like little kids...
Maybe he thinks only kids talk to mascots?

WELCOME TO WAKEPORT!
This is the best resort spot on Pi'illo Island!
You're our first visitor today! And so...
You should talk to our clerk at the info center right here!
He'll tell you everything about events and facilities in town!
Enjoy your time here in scenic Wakeport!
Welcome!
Have fun!
Come by anytime!
Mr. Mario! Mr. Luigi! How ARE you guys?!
Don't you think this is such a pretty town?
Ancient ruins! Left pristine for the tourist hordes!
I can't wait to see them! I'm so excited!
Mr. Mario! Mr. Luigi! Did you see that castle?!
A lot of people evacuated out of here...
But not this Toad! I know you guys are on the job!
The hotel was all full, so I couldn't get a room.
But the town seems safe... I could sleep outside...
But I'm not really sure I wanna be that guy...
I figured NOW was the time to snag a hotel room, y'know?
I ran all the way back from the blimport, but no luck!
I guess I have to camp out until somebody leaves...
I just want to relax and take a nap in the shade...
But someone's up there! I FEEL IT! I can't sleep!
So yeah, I read in the Wakeport guidebook?
Yeah! If you run around these fountains...
Guess what! Your wish will come totally true!
That's why my brother and me are running!
I took a quick nap at the hotel, and now my fatigue is gone!
Let that be a lesson! Take care of yourself while on vacation!
I thought Pi'illo Island was going to be destroyed by that castle...
So I ran to the blimport! And then I ran back. I am EXHAUSTED.
At times like this, it would be nice to have a good nap in the hotel!
Well, well, WELL! Where to next?
I should probably visit the tour center...
There's gotta be a tour for me!
Gosh, I ran away for nothing, and now I'm super tired.
Whatever. At least nobody got injured, you know?
Whoa... Dizzy...
Hey! Get down NOW! You mind me!
You're the older brother! Set a good example!
Mom, quit yelling! I lost count on the laps...
Plus, why do you always want ME to set an example?
Who cares if I'm older?! It's not like I'm any wiser!
Kids! Always with the energy! Always nightmares on trips!
Good thing their mother has energy to spare chasing them...
Get down! NOW!
That castle! I was sure it was going to blast the island.
So I gathered up the fam and made a run for the blimport.
But that crowd! It was insane. But it calmed down after a bit...
So we came back here... but I'm still a little leery...
This is the town's info center! Can I help you with anything?
I...kinda wanna leave! But I... kinda gotta stay! It's my job!
The tour center 
Local events 
The badge campaign 
Never mind
The tour center organizes tours around Pi'illo Island.
Of course, each is led by professional tour guides!
The next tour, in fact, is a trek up the mighty mountain...
Mount Pajamaja!
If you'd like to go on the tour, you need to get registered.
Go all the way west from here to find the tour center!
You do NOT want to miss it! Seriously, I bet you'll love it!
Well, the Mad Skillathon is being held at the south event stage!
You can get super prizes if you show off your super skills!
Audience participation is most definitely encouraged! Good luck!
Ooh, yes, we got a notice from the badge shop, Badgeport!
The first two customers get a free lesson in badge usage!
That shop owner loves badges! Isn't he so generous?!
Anyway, first come, first served! Good luck getting there first!
The badge shop is no longer doing their special campaign!
Too bad, I know. They're back to doing regular business now.
OK, then... HAVE FUN!
Anything else you'd like me to explain?
Tired from your trip? HIT THIS HOTEL!
Take a quick rest! IT'LL DO YOU GOOD!
Think the hotel's closed?! NOPE, IT'S OPEN!
Take a quick napperoo! IT'LL DO YOU GOOD!
Trash-cleaning rule one!
Leave no trash behind!
Trash-cleaning rule two!
Leave no coins either!
So I'm in charge of cleaning here, but I...ran away for a bit.
I figured I'd come back and it'd be, like, REALLY gross.
But it's way, WAY cleaner than I thought it would be!
Follow this road to the left, and you'll hit the tour center!
You'll know it's the place when you see brochures out front!
I guess nobody can really say what all the ruckus was...
I mean, I'm probably more confused than anyone else...
Y'know what? I'm just gonna do my job until things chill.
After all, what was that castle doing up there?
Who put it up there? And why? And HOW?
Spooky that we don't know anything about it...
When I'm done with this part-time job...
I'm getting me a girlfriend. Definitely.
After seeing that strange castle, I really want to get out of here...
But I've got a crucial job to do... Surveilling this lovey-dovey couple.
THEY LOOK SUSPICIOUS!
I've kept a close watch on this "couple" for quite a while now!
And I'll tell you, there's no telling how deep the rabbit hole goes!
I'm thinking they're international superspies at the very LEAST!
Definitely feels like someone's looking at me from the left... OK.
Do they want to take a picture? Shake hands with me? What?
I can't wait! Maybe I'll take the initiative and talk to them first!
OK, so nobody's looking at me now... They all took off.
So now I'm a mascot that no one cares about at all...
That's the saddest thing ever! I hate that stupid castle!
Everyone who fled came back, and now the place is jumping!
But...nobody wants to come hang out with the fun mascot!
Time to break out the emergency plan: impromptu sing 'n' dance!
Ah, it's tough being mega popular!
Dahh... Too hot!
Can't...do it anymore...
How do people DO this?
Please... Take this...
Keep my failure secret...
It's so stuffy...
And I think...
I stink...bad...
Sounds bad...
Something bad...
Bad stuff happened...
And I'm still hot...
This town is full of places to see and, yes, places to dream!
Find a place that suits you, and do what pleases you best!
Giant evil sky castles really aren't good for tourism...
This town BUSTLED, but then the tourists took off!
I just hope it can become lively again someday...
Welcome to Wakeport!
People evacuated, but now they RE-vacuated!
This place wasn't the same without them!
I guess there was an earthquake in the park a little while ago.
We felt the ground shake a bit around here, but everything's fine!
Please relax and enjoy your time in Wakeport!
This is where all the hotels in this town are!
If you go all the way west, you'll find the tour center!
If you go south from here, you'll hit the shop district!
I confessed my love to this girl while hooing here on vacation.
Turned out she loved me hoo! I'm on top of the hoo!
Sky castles, disasters, acts of hoo... Hoo cares!
I'll always protect hoo! I promise you that!
This place is hoomazing... The atmosphere...hoomantic.
My boyfriend really knows how to lay on the hoo!
My boyfriend swore to protect me, come hoo or high water!
But if that castle starts firing hoo beams at the main island...
What's he gonna hoo then? What CAN he hoo?
Me and two good friends came hoo on vacation!
But now they hooed off! Where did they hoo?
I came here with two friends, but little did I hoo...
They secretly started dating each other! Unbelieva-hoo!
It surprised me more than that hooey castle in the air!
Come on, let's tell him already!
Why don't you do it?
It'll only take two seconds, right?
Then you should just go do it!
Yeah... But...
So awkward...telling someone... their zipper is open...
The Wakehaus  -VACANCY- 
(I'm sure that castle will go away soon!)
(Anyway, I have bigger fish to fry!)
(Mission one while traveling is to enjoy the local cuisine!!)
(I'd be so happy if I ate a rare fruit!)
(If you find one, PLEASE tell me!)
(If you find a rare fruit somewhere, let me know!)
(Wow! What's that? Is that a fruit from this island?)
(I've just GOTTA try it! Can I have that rare fruit?)
(Can I please have it?) 
No          
Yes
(Ahhh, I'm so jealous! I wanna eat one, too!)
(Yay! Thank you!)
(I'm SO excited!)
(I'll trade you! Please take this!)
(I'm sure you've seen a few of these in your day...)
(But someone near the tour center wanted to see it!)
You handed over the rare fruit!
You got a Yoshi egg!
(That Yoshi egg is pretty cute, don't you think?)
(Someone near the tour center is way into it!)
(The rare fruit you gave me was absolutely delectable!)
(So good that I'm thinking about moving to this island!)
Mario! Luigi! Hey, guys!
Umm... Have you seen my camera, by any chance?
I think I accidentally dropped it down there...
I figured I'd look for it from a higher viewpoint.
I haven't had any luck so far, though...
Maybe someone already found it and took it...
Sniff... My camera... I wonder where it is now...
If you find it, please let me know, OK?!
Oh my gosh! That's it! That's my camera!
Can I have it back, please? 
No          
Yes
Ohhh, you big kidder! I'm not falling for that!
I KNOW you, Mario. You're a kind person!
I know you'll give it back to me!
Phew! Come to me, camera! Aw, you guys are the best!
I really want to give you something in return...
But I don't think I have anything on me...
Oh! Hang on!
You returned the lost camera!
I found...something while I was looking for my camera.
Y'know how there are two fountains near the entrance to this town?
OK, near the light-green grass between the parasol and the fountain to the left...
Yeah, I saw a bird burying something around that place earlier.
No idea if that's useful... It might be, like, a seed.
But whatever it is, you can dig it out for sure!
If you want to check it out, go to it!
You got the Pi'illo ring! It looks like an antique!
So that bird WAS burying something cool!
And I knew you'd be able to find it!
What's that music?

I heard so many voices whilst in the void...
Oh, how I longed to join in their revelry!
I longed to enjoy my life again!
And now I can! Thank you!
Hello there! 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
I'm still surprised you got past that gate!
You guys are real puzzle masters!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
All of the Pi'illo folk have now been freed.
My deepest thanks, Mario and Luigi!
Let's go to Mushrise Park and tell Eldream.
Hi, little Zeekeeper! Aren't you so cute!
What do YOU like to eat, little guy?
I came back here because I wanted to see the Zeekeeper!
Ooh, little Zeekeeper! Who's cuter'n you?
Do you have a job? Is it...being CUTE?
I couldn't leave little Zeekeeper, so I came running back!
Oh, little Zeekeeper! Are you the fluffiest?
Can I jump on you? Are you THAT fluffy?
I came back because I HAD to pet the Zeekeeper!
Hey, guys! Listen, if you're looking to walk the rampart like I was...
You're gonna hit a big dead end. Right there. A huge wall.
It LOOKS like there's a path up there, but...
Anyway, I bet you guys can, like, jump over it someday!
Me, I'm gonna see if I can just STARE the wall down!
So I was exploring, like I usually do...
Next thing I know, everyone was gone!
And I STILL haven't breached that wall...
A photo of the ruins in a scenic spot? Brilliant!
This'll SLAY my friends back in the kingdom!
I'll remember this shot forever!
Would you guys like to take one with me?
Who thought up taking photos at scenic spots? A genius!
Thanks to that, I'll be able to keep my good memories!
Have you been to the tour center yet?
All kinds of limited-time tours in that place!
I took the Mushrise Park flower tour!
I've gotta see what the next tour is!
Supposedly there's a new tour around Mount Pajamaja!
I came back from the blimport, but the tour had left! DANG!
The tour guides are all out, so there are no tours...
This is the first time I ever traveled by myself.
Everything feels...new! And exciting! Dangerous!
It's like I'm discovering... myself! I'm a self-explorer!
I really need a date... I USED to think that...
BUT NO MORE!
Everyone kind of went nuts when that castle appeared...
But I'm thinking you should stay calm at such times.
Say there was a damsel in distress next to me right now...
I've gotta be honest, I think I would handle myself like a...
...TOTAL HERO!
Whoa, I wonder what this panel here is for?
This whole place just reeks of atmosphere!
These are, like...remains of antiquity or something!
This feels kinda weird... Why am I so popular now?
I guess maybe it's just... MY TIME TO SHINE!
All the guests are gone. They all ran away.
Popularity...cut short. Time to shine...over.
All the guests that ran away came back!
Time to shine has been reactivated!
I still don't understand these three Toads...
Why do they like me so much? Seriously.
You know, some parts of the island are only accessible via tours!
You're welcome to stop by the tour center anytime you want!
I guess nobody would even think about going on a tour now...
Only one thing to do: take advantage of the madness!
New tour, folks! WEIRD-SPACE- CASTLE EXPLODING TOUR!
Hahahah! Juuuuuuust kidding! Hee hee... Eheh... That was sad.
Sweet guests... I wonder if they'll all come back...
Hey, everyone came back, so we started a new tour!
If you're into it, head straight for Mount Pajamaja!
Our seasoned guides are waiting there for you!
How was the new tour on Mount Pajamaja?
If it tuckered you out, hit the inn for some rest!
This old ruin is still shrouded in mystery...
Our survey crew is researching it HARD!
If you go across this bridge, you'll find the clock-tower plaza.
A lot of tours use that spot as a gathering point!
If you go across this bridge, you'll find the clock-tower plaza.
It's nothing special, but I always liked that place.
I'm glad it wasn't, y'know, castle-blasted.
Feel free to look around! Go on—snoop a bit!
You know what's the best about Wakeport tours?
You can look, you can listen, and you can touch!
There's an ancient monument open for public viewing here.
But...I'm afraid the grounds are a bit crowded right now!
The visitors we have now should be leaving soon...
I highly encourage you to come back later and see it!
The tourist crowd has flocked elsewhere!
You can look around as much as you want now.
Look at stuff, touch it, or sleep on a random pillow!
Well... That last bit was just a little staff humor.

You hoo the key to having fun traveling?
You HAVE to hoo a guidebook!
It's kind of hooey, though... The same hoo wrote all of 'em!
That castle is still around... but it's not hooing anything!
I hooed out my entire bank account for this vacation!
I'm gonna enjoy this time to the absolute hooest!
A mysterious ruin hooed by ancient Pi'illo folk!
I wonder hoo they were using this place!
(There's an archaeological site just ahead of here!)
(It was MAGICAL! I'm still excited!)
(Everyone got scared of the castle and ran away!)
(Thanks to that castle, I could take my time looking around the ruins!)
(I wonder what that mysterious castle was all about?)
(It just appeared in the sky... It was like a waking dream...)
I am the gatekeeper...
Reset the panels? 
No           
Yes
Are you sure? 
No          
Yes
You will be awed upon awakening!
The gate has opened. You may pass.
All panels are in their original spots...
I am the gatekeeper...
Come back later...
Uh-oh... I was too deep in thought and missed my shot to run!
Well, whatever. Might as well make the most of it. I was thinking...
Mr. Mario! Mr. Luigi! How are you two doing?
I see a lot of Yoshis around on this island.
I'm just gonna come right out and ask it...
I always wanted to see...a Yoshi egg.
Awww... Yoshi egg... I wish I could see you once...
I can't just ask a Yoshi... That'd be...weird.
Hold up a sec, Mr. Mario! You have a...
YOSHI EGG!
Oh my! Can I look at it? 
No          
Yes
Sniff... Mr. Mario... You're not MY hero...
Really? I can have it? Thank you so much!
Gosh... The polka dots are soooo pretty!
They're like what I have up top! We're related!
Hey, this isn't much, but take this with you!
I snapped one shot as we arrived on this island!
You handed over the Yoshi egg!
You got Peach's photo!
Princess Peach seems pretty popular even on this island!
In fact, I met one of her huge fans somewhere in this area!
Knowing that the princess of my own country is so popular...
It makes me really proud to be on her staff!
I don't really care about that castle in the sky!
I've got more important things on my mind!
I heard that Princess Peach is here on Pi'illo Island!
But I can't try to meet her because I'm stuck researching the ruins!
Seriously, I am her hugest fan. No lie. This is KILLING me...
At this point, even a quick peek at Peach's photo would be enough...
I'm so busy researching the ruins, I can't even see Princess Peach!
That's... IT CAN'T BE! Is that really...
PEACH'S PHOTO?
P-please! Let me see! 
No          
Yes
Gaaah, you awful, greedy man! You came to rub it in my face!
Whoa! Can I really have it? For real? Thank you!
I mean, it's just a photo, but WHAT a photo!
Here! To express my gratitude! Please take it with you!
That's a superrare guide booklet. Only us researchers get it!
It's funny, there was a total nut looking for it at the store, but...
It's not for sale. You could show it to him and blow his mind!
You handed over Peach's photo!
You got the Book of Ruins!
That Book of Ruins is really rare. Seriously, ask around!
This one guidebook maniac was looking for it at the store, but...
Sadly for him, they don't sell it. You could go blow his mind with it!
I never get tired of looking at Princess Peach...
That cascading hair... Perfect! Those cheekbones... Sublime!
Boo! Boo, I say!
There's supposed to be treasure in this dump!
But it ain't here, see? I've been bamboozled!
Yeeeowch!
Watch where ya goin', ya clumsy mugs!
Ya think ya can just bump into the Great Popple?
You're lookin' at a legend, see? A LEGEND.
I've swiped treasures from every corner of the world!
The Shadow Thief!
The Baron of Burgle!
COME OFF IT!
Criminy...
I give up.
I know shmoes like you...
Yeah, I met me some fat-stached palookas...
And they're TROUBLE!
Trouble, I say!
YEEEARGH!
Just rememberin' that gets on my last nerve!
Those punks, gettin' in my biz in the Beanbean Kingdom!
Ooh, I hate 'em! Those drips! Those beardy bumbleheads!
HEH!
But I'll make a fresh start on this island!
I'm leavin', see? Off to filch my next treasure!
What was THAT all about, huh?
Well, whatever... Let's find the tour center!
Time to climb that Mount Pajamaja!
Hey! Is that who I think it is?!
Cripes! Took me a while, but I found it!
The secret of that Pi'illoper creep's house!
Why hide the second-floor entrance like that?
It was right in front of my nose the whole time, see?
JACKPOT! Heh heh!
Those drips'll know I'm makin' for that second floor...
But their snoopin' ain't gonna stop me, see?
I swiped this here map from the info center...
So findin' the way in will be a cinch!
PERFECT! Heh heh!
Soon as I snatch that loot, I'm bookin' it outta here!
I never understand a word he's saying...
But it sounds like a Pi'illo collector lives there.

I'm trying to decide what kind of souvenirs I should bring back...
If only I could just tell stories of my trip to my friends...
"A giant castle heaved into the sky and bombarded Pi'illo Island!"
"FWASH! A beam from the castle! BOOM! Explosions rock the seas!"
"A single Toad dodges through the explosions like a rotund cat!"
"As the land sinks below the sea, he barely escapes! In a chopper!"
Not bad, right? Telling that would be way cheaper than souvenirs...
Instead of getting souvenirs, I just wanna give anecdotes...
Hello!
I was just wandering around lost and wound up here!
Heck of a view, though, right? I think I'll chill up here for a bit.
Oh, by the way...
A friend of mine went up along that walkway...
He hasn't come back yet, and it's been a bit...
If you see him, let him know I'm looking for him, OK?
Feeling the wind like this in a foreign country...
It makes me really hungry. Why, I have no idea...
I was here the whole time, so I saw EVERYTHING!
Beams from that castle blasted the barrier islands!
I was here the whole time, so I saw EVERYTHING!
You rode a huge bird and KO'd that castle! INSANE!
You guys are heroes even while you're on vacation!
Go smite evil and bring peace to the island!
Is Bowser being bad again?
Do you see the ruins on the other side?
They left them intact while developing the resort town.
And good thing! It's one of the tourist draws in town!
Whoever thought of that is like the king of marketing!
They purposely left the ruins intact during resort development...
But after seeing that castle attacking those small barrier islands...
It made me feel like the developers are like a castle, blasting the ruins.
Well...maybe that's going just a BIT overboard.
It's just, seeing all that go down was shocking...
It's kinda shifted my entire worldview, y'know?
I hear this island was ravaged by an evil guy a long time ago.
But now it seems so peaceful! It's the perfect travel destination!
During that mass panic, I ran to the blimport, too.
It was packed there, though, so I just rolled back here.
I don't exactly think of this place as "peaceful" anymore.
I know for sure that there are some bad guys in that castle!
I just hope this island doesn't get ravaged like it did long ago...
This is the town's shopping district!
Apparel, items... It's all here!
Everyone ran away... And man, I WANTED to!
But the shopping district has so many stores...
I figure someone had to stay to stop any looters!
All the tourists fled a while back, but they all returned!
I'm just glad I didn't have to throw down with looters!
This is a badge store called...Badgeport!
Special campaign going on in there right now!
Big chance to learn about badges for free!
Drop in if you're into that sort of thing!
Ahem! This is a badge store called...Badgeport!
Our special campaign ended, but pop in anyway!
YEEEK! Sky-castle invasion! We've all gotta fleeeeee!
But my boss, the guy who owns the badge shop, said no!
He said my shift isn't over yet. You believe that? Seriously.
I mean, I guess I have no choice, but that is messed up...
The ground SHOOK before! We've all gotta fleeeeeee!
But my boss, the owner of the badge store, said no!
He told me I have to work until my shift officially ends...
I guess I have no choice, but that is just WRONG...
Us Shelltops are used to living near the ocean.
This town reminds me of home...and I love it!
Everyone stampeded to the blimport, so I bet it's a mess.
Me, I'm just going to stay here until the dust settles.
Nothing like a quiet sea town... Just like home!
A lot of Shelltops came here for the resort work.
A fair number went home, though, after all the unrest...
Me, I really like this town. I think I'll stick around.
Are you interested in the Mount Pajamaja tour?
In that case, go register at the tour center!
To get to the tour center, go west on this road...
Then cross the bridge to the north in the next area.
The tour leaves soon, so you should hurry!
Big Massif is a really good tour guide, except...
He oversleeps ALL the time. He shows up late a lot.
If he's not around, I guarantee he's snoring his head off.
More than half of the guests ran away...
I have no idea where would be a safe spot.
There's nowhere that castle can't blast!
You think that castle is going to attack again?
I saw those barrier islands get blasted...
Now I'm freaking out to the nth degree!
Where should I go after I hoo around Wakeport?
Down to Driftwood Shore, get a tan on my hoo?
Hoo now? I'm already tan? What a hoo thing to say!
(Traveling is fun, but I'm getting so out of shape...)
(I feel like running around with someone on my back!)
(Gee, I wonder why everyone left town?)
(That castle appearing suddenly... Must be part of a festival!)
(It feels so nice to rest in the shade!)
(The salty breeze feels amazing!)
(Ahh, my eyelids are starting to close...)

Hoo! Such pretty flowers! So glad we came hoo!
Everyone hooed out when that castle appeared...
But if Hoolo is staying, then I'm staying hoo!
He'll keep me safe as a hoo at a hootenanny!
No way a castle just hoos into the sky like that!
Gotta be some tourist hoo-de-doo... Anyhoo...
Hoola...
Hoo man, why am I such a chicken...
I just have to spit out... "Will hoo marry me?"
Why'd I even hoo out the cash for this trip...
And this gift I hooed her... Talk about kid's stuff...
No way she says yes to my proposal... I'm hooed.
Hoo there! Look at you hoo, with the big old staches!
Bet those make hoo popular! Yup, yup, hoo bet!
Anyhoo, since you're popular, I trust hoo to help me out!
Can hoo find me something to help me propose to my girl?
A gift... Not too hooish...but with the right amount of hoo!
If all goes well, I'll give hoo everything I own!
Will hoo help me? 
No          
Yes
Too cool to help a hoo in trouble, huh...
Well, if hoo change your minds...
THANK HOO!
As an advance, I'll hoo you one thing!
You find something nice, bring it to me for a hoo!
Hoo now! Almost forgot...
If hoo don't mind, take this with hoo!
I won't need it anymore anyhoo...
And I saw someone hoo wanted it really bad!
You got a plush Zeekeeper!
I-I'm...counting on hoo two!
Hoolo! Come look at this beautiful flower!
That's the plush Zeekeeper that I originally bought, hoo?
Way hoo cute for a marriage proposal, is what I'm thinking...
But I hooed someone in a nearby store wanted one!
Hoo now, is that a rare fruit?
Giving food for a marriage proposal seems...hooey.
Someone in the hootel district wanted that, though...
Hoo now? Is that a... Yoshi egg?
It's cute as a hoo's hoo, but it won't do...
But someone's gotta hoo for it, guaranteed!
Someone by the tour center, if I had to hoo...
Your hoo is to make my girl jealous with this photo?
Are you out of your hoo?! I can't hoo that!
But I CAN tell you there's a guy hoo would want it!
Yeah, he was hooing by the ruins, researching...
Whoa, that's a hoo-dinger! That book's hooper rare!
But it's about as romantic as a soggy hoo, y'know?
This roundish Beanish guy would hoo to have it, though...
Yeah, he was in a store near here! No hooing!
What in the hoo is that green thing? Hoo MAN.
Oops... Hoo, that's the Beanbean Kingdom's queen...
Maybe she's not as hoogly to the Beanish, y'know?
Anyhoo, there's a big Beanish family around hoo!
They're staying in the biggest hootel in town!
Take a hoo—you can see someone's name written on that camera...
Some poor hoo lost it and is probably looking for it now!
They're probably hooing close to where you found it, y'know?
Anyhoo, I'd feel wrong taking it! Return it as soon as you hoo!
The lost camera belongs to that cool hoo Toad!
I like that hoo. I bet he'll give you a hoo reward!
Talk to him over and over, if you ask hoo!
Hoo now, is that...
Hoo DOGGIES! That's a precious, ancient Pi'illo ring!
You hoos aren't just cool looking—you ARE cool!
Hoola's going to flip her hoo when she sees it!
OK... I'll hoo this over... and ask her to marry me!
HOOLA!
Hey, Hoolo! What's hooing?
I, um... P-p-please... Hoo for you!
Hoo my! What a ring! I'm so hoopy!
And... I...also... Will hoo... Uh...
Will you...wi...will... wiii wiii wiii wiii...
What's up with hoo?
WILL HOO MARRY ME?!
Hoo...
Oh, uh... This was so kind of hoo!
And what a hootiful ring you found me...
My answer is...
Of course...
HOO YEAH!
HOORAY!
I owe it all to hoo guys!
Gotta hoo up my end of the bargain! Just as I promised!
Hoo did amazing work! You're stand-up hoos!
That proposal kind of caught me off hoo!
But I'm hoo happy! I love this island!
I owe you hoo-time! Thank hoo, guys!
I've gotta hoo something for you guys in return!
Gimme a hoo! What can I hoo? Anything!
You need some big hooing guy called Big Massif?
Well, remember hoo can walk on the town walls...
Keep a hoo out for hidden paths and areas!
Hoo want to climb Mount Pajamaja?
Shake your hoo to the tour center!
Lime green, in the northwest of town!
Where do the tour hoos meet up?
The clock tower to the west, if I hoo correctly!
Yup, that's the hoo! Get a hoo on!
You got a 1-Up Mushroom!
You got a Heart Bean DX!
You got Rally Wear!
You got a Sap Hammer!
I... I am back to normal! I have longed for this day!
Within my petrified state, I heard the din of voices...
Ever did I wish to know what was going on!
Now I am free to see what happenings are in town!
Many thanks for your help, mustached ones!
How fare you? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
This place has grown so lively in my absence!
So many faces... Creatures I've never even seen before!
It is a fine thing, to have so many visit our fair island!
While I was trapped, I sensed there was a bigger crowd here...
I expected more people, yes... This feels almost...lonely.
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
All of the Pi'illo folk have now been freed.
My deepest thanks, Mario and Luigi!
We must go to Mushrise Park and tell Eldream.
Tourists!
You're here for the tour to Mount Pajamaja, yes?
The tour center let us know you'd be coming!
Orientation is about to start!
C'mon, let's go! This way, please!
IS TOUR TIME!
I am muscled guide for tour of Mount Pajamaja!
I am younger Massif Bro! Am called Li'l Massif!
You just made it! Please enjoy your tour!
Is tough, climbing Mount Pajamaja!
Da, mountain separates beef from side salad!
Let guard down on mountain, and mountain CRUSH you!
Is only one true goal of tour...
LIVE TO BEEF AGAIN!
Is end.
Umm... Excuse me...
Da? Questions?
I don't think I can handle all the...beef.
I'm sorry, but I'm breaking out!
That tour center didn't make it sound as hard as hoo...
I'm hooing out! I don't wanna risk my hoos on some cliff!
What...do you think?
I'm freaking out, that's what! Do I look beefy to you?!
(I just thought I'd find yummy fruits on the mountain...)
(But risking my life for it... No way! I'm gone!)
Hoo...
Hoo... Hoo... HooOOUCH! Aw hoo, sudden stomachache!
Can't hoo a mountain in this condition... Hoo bad! Hoouch...
Uh? Tourists still here. Is for real?
Cutlets still want to climb Mount Pajamaja?
Uh, really?
Da... Da, so then Mount Pajamaja tour begins...
NOW!
I say this usually, but uh... Uhhhhh...
What's the matter? Let's go already!
This is thing...
Tour usually run by me and brother, Big Massif.
But I am not finding him in any of usual places...
Whaaat?! The tour guide went missing?
We NEED to go to Mount Pajamaja!
Hnngh... Gahhhh...
IS NEW TOUR!
Is change of plans! New tour called...
BIG MASSIF HUNT!
EXTREME BEEFING!
WAKEPORT TOUR!
Um... You have got to be kidding...
What do you guys think?
That's true... We don't really have a choice.
OK, look, big guy, we'll find your big brother for you.
But when we do, you have to start the REAL tour!
Da, is shameful...
But da, once brother comes, we climb Mount Pajamaja!
It looks like we can go beyond this area, too!
To east is big shopping district.
Is place for buying things!
Let's turn the town upside down and find this guy!
Hello, Mario Bros.!
The plaza with the clock tower is just ahead!
It seems really popular, but I can't tell why.
The clock tower over there is the worst tourist attraction...
Wanna know what it's called? "Ordinary Clock Tower."
It's more like a pillar, or a pole, or something. Talk about lame...
Y'know how you just KNOW a spot is going to disappoint you...
But you get excited wondering HOW disappointing it'll be?
This'll actually be my first time climbing a mountain!
I'm pretty dang excited! Also pretty dang nervous!
Majestic Mount Pajamaja... I wonder what it's like.
Soon I'll know firsthand, 'cause I'm gonna CLIMB it!
The tour center made it sound like this tour was pretty tough.
Gotta say, I'm impressed so many here are up to it!
You probably know lots of Pi'illo ruins are on this island.
Yeah, while a lot of this place is developed for visitors...
Somnom Woods is basically untouched by tourism.
I bet the forest is amazingly mystical and spooky!
Hello! Need any directions for getting around town?
North (↑) is the tour center! East (→) is the shop district!
South (↓) is the event stage! Hope that helps!
They say this wall was erected by Pi'illos in ancient times.
I love the way they left the ruins intact in this town...
Blending them in with the new buildings... Brilliant move!
Wait... The wall is gone!
Are you thinking about the Mount Pajamaja tour?
You've gotta register at the tour center!
To get to the tour center, go west on this road...
Then cross the bridge to the north in the next area.
Cross this bridge, and you'll get to the tour center.
I think that tour leaves soon, so don't be late!
I may not look like I'm in prime hoo, but I've got major stamina!
I'll climb any kind of mountain, no matter how hoo it is!
Hooskis are mountain folk! We hoo at the heights!
The tour guide hoos me out... I'd better give this a second hoo...
(As soon as we reach that mountain, it's time to hunt rare fruit!)
(Walking, climbing, jumping... It all comes naturally to me!)
(Climbing a mountain should be as easy as skipping for me!)
Where is large bro? Is leaving time...
Large bro is somewhere in town! Da, is certain!
He is master of local geography and ruins.
He is maybe in place where tourists cannot go...
You must hunt large bro! Follow trail of beef!

Thank you so much, Mario and Luigi!
Hurry to Mushrise Park and tell Eldream!
Ah!
Dearest Misters Mario and Luigi!
We've awaited you.
Your presence is requested in the room to the rear.
Please head that way.
Mr. Mario and Mr. Luigi! A fine welcome to you!
I'm quite sure discerning gentlemen like you will appreciate the thing!
And by thing, I mean the thing Broque Madame was showing us!
The thing she showed us was a bit strange...
Would one want to own such a thing? Questionable.
All right, huddle up, tour group!
I'd like to start with a notable spot here on Driftwood Shore.
Gravy...
Please direct your gazes to the statues over here.
Many of these statues can be found along the beach.
Their purpose, and the identity of those who created them...
Well, folks, these remain mysteries to this day!
In fact, so much remains unknown about these cryptic monuments...
They've been designated as one of the Seven Wonders of Pi'illo Island!
All right, tour group! Free time!
Please wander about this area for a bit before we continue.
Boo! Boo, I say! I heard there was something really rare here, see?
But these weird statues ain't gonna make me a single coin!
Boo on this boring beach! I'm out of here, see?
Gotta be better treasure around here somewhere!
Huh?
ST-STATUES!
AND BRIDGE!
MA-MAJOR DISCOVERY!
MUST TELL EVERYONE...
TOUR'S OVER!
Ahem! Please enjoy the local sights and sounds!
THIS is the super-popular spot? The brochure made it sound better...
Wow! Now THAT is amazing! Woo-hooo! Driftwood Shooore!
Statues? Boring...
Statues? So cool!
These are such mystical statues!
I was here! Oh, wow! I witnessed history!
I wonder why someone would make these...
Whoa! Who woulda guessed the statues marked a bridge!
People don't realize hoo amazing us Hooskis are at swimming!
It's our hollow trunks! We float like inflatable hoo-boats!
Unless...we spring a leak. Hoo better believe that's bad...
Once we start taking on water, we sink like petrified hoo...
I came here with an old college buddy of mine...
Problem is, he says it's too hot! He never wants to leave the shade.
I'm like, dude. It's a beach. What did you think it'd be like?
Me and my buddy came here since we heard it was a hot spot...
I thought it was a figure of speech! I'm like a baked bean over here...
The sight of the sea washes my cares away...
Not too much surf action. Oughta be good swimming.
Hey, Mario! What's up! You enjoying the beach?
Yeah, even with some sky-castle invasion...
We might as well live it up a little, right?
Tell me I'm not crazy... You feel that quake earlier?
Any idea what happened?
That castle in the sky vaporized the little reef islands around here...
But, uh... None of the beachgoers seem the slightest bit concerned.
So...I guess everything's fine?
That giant castle plunged to earth and caused an earthquake...
But, uh... None of the tourists here even batted an eye.
So...I guess everything's fine?
The weather is so nice!
I'm gonna get my tan on!
Ah, sweet tanning... Cares cast aside...
This is the definition of resort life...
To Driftwood Shore! May your tides be high!
Haaah... That sun feels so GOOD!
Huh? The castle in the sky?
Unless it blocks the sun, who cares?!
No castle messes with my tan!
Today's goal: a super tan!
Sunbathing while buried up to my hoo in sand...
Is there any better way to hoo the toxins out?
Nope! Detoxifying the bod is the hooest!
OH MY HOO YES! Feels hoo good!
You guys should hoo this too!
This is sunbathing, Hooski-style!
Hoo? What am I hooing?
Sunbathing. Can't you hoo?
This is how us Hooskis hoo it.
Gotta bury your hoo in the sand.
Those guys buried in the sand... are sunbathing, apparently.
Different strokes for different folks, huh? The world is wild.
I went swimming for a bit and got tired...
But I regret nothing! I feel invigorated!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
Can I help? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
SWEET LIFE!
Thank you with all my heart!
I owe you my very life!
Strange... Why do so many creatures gather here?!
Is there a festival of some kind going on?

Mr. Mario, you should give it a try, too!
I ran for the blimport during that mass panic earlier...
But then I thought, y'know what? Everything'll be OK.
And y'know why? Because you guys will protect us!
Unless, of course, you told me that Bowser is in that castle...
In which case I am in the breeze in, like, two seconds.
Mr. Mario, I think you guys should have a go at this!
I'm pretty sure you have skills! Go win some prizes!
Have you noticed that after you stare doom in the eye...
The simplest pleasures are suddenly the best thing ever!
I have a hobby, but I wouldn't exactly call it a "mad skill."
Unless loafing around my house is really "mad."
Despite the arrival of that weird castle, it's calm here.
Why waste time worrying? Let's get our relax on!
Didja know our queen has superhuman strength?
We oughta get her to do this contest!
The queen in our kingdom is strong as a bodybuilding ox!
I tell you, if there's somebody evil in that freaky castle...
Our queen would DEFINITELY put the hurting on him!
Time to sign up for this contest and snare some nice prizes!
You can participate in the Mad Skillathon whenever!
Just pop in and strut your stuff for sweet prizes!

Throw down in the Mad Skillathon? 
No          
Yes
Come again, yo!
Some jacked castle all up in the sky...
Ain't no thang, yo! Forget all that...
Guest! To the east, you can find the ruins!
But, guest! You will also find monsters.
They are NOT part of the official resort!
Welcome to the Wakeport event stage!
We're holding something called the Mad Skillathon!
Welcome to the event stage!
Lots of people ran away after seeing that castle...
But the Mad Skillathon goes on—rain, shine, or castle!
To be honest, I also wanted to bolt.
But I just can't miss any mad skills!
I guess that castle ISN'T going to attack the main island.
Which is good! Makes it easier to get contestants, y'know?
You're looking for Big Massif? Yeah, good luck with that.
I've heard he has this spot where he likes to take naps...
But I have no idea where that spot might be... Sorry.
Look around town! I bet you'll find it eventually!
Hey, you found Big Massif! Solid work!
Guy's a great tour guide! Just a little sleepy...
The Massif Bros. are out of town on "beef" business.
Apparently they have a new Mount Pajamaja tour.
Huh?! You survived the Massif Bros.' new tour?!
Boy, you guys must be climbing maniacs!
Hoo's next up? Get hooing!
I hooed that the hovering castle got shot down!
Hoo could've pulled THAT off, I wonder! Hoo-WEE!
Whoever hooed that castle oughta hit the Mad Skillathon!
Oh mercy, I've never hooed such "mad skills"!
I feel like I'm out of my depth at this hoo-ha.
But now all I can hoo about is crazy skills!
Some of the tourists that hooed for the hills came back!
It's a good hoo, too! Contests like this are better with crowds!
(Actually, I have one special skill I can show off!)
(I'm a super-fast eater! I can eat 20 fruits in 30 seconds!)
(As you can imagine, my belly gets REALLY big afterward...)
(I realized it's safer to stick around this area!)
(Think about it! Everyone here has what they call mad skills!)
(You know what's good in a crisis? Mad skills.)
(I'm just not sure "big appetite" and "decent hearing" qualify as skills...)
(Skills that are too unique probably don't play well with this crowd.)
(It's so much fun seeing people's special skills!)
(If you have any special skills, you should get up there!)
(I was really scared when that castle appeared...)
(But seeing the Mad Skillathon makes me forget all about it!)
(I like watching people who look like they'll fail! Is that so wrong?)
I am the gatekeeper...
Reset the panels? 
No          
Yes
Are you sure? 
No          
Yes
You will be awed upon awakening!
The gate has opened. You may pass.
All panels are in their original spots...
What up, playas! Diggin' on them mustaches you got!
Want the skinny on this joint? 
No          
Yes
Ain't no thang, baby! C'mon back any old time, yo!
Right HERE is where we drop the Mad Skillathon, yo!
You got some skills, you break 'em out here for LOOT, baby!
Whazat? Y'all ain't got no skills?
Y'ALL CLOWNIN'!
Think I ain't peeped them shaggy staches y'all got?!
Wearin' them different colors with ever-lovin' OVERALLS?!
Man, it's plain as day...
Y'all are comedians!
Y'all AIN'T?
Well, shut my mouth... Y'all LOOK like a good duo.
Maybe y'all got some kinda combo skill or somethin'?!
Hold up, son. What's that, yo?
You can use THAT...to combo up and drop fools in the dirt?!
ILL, YO!
Listen, bruh, that's EXACTLY what y'all gotta show the crowd, feel me?
Don't have to be right now if y'all ain't feelin' it!
You come hit this up anytime you up for some skills.
You know what to do, baby! Just come talk to ol' Skillit!
Aw yeah!
Skills!
Slammin'!
Holla!
Yeah, baby!
Unh! C'mon!
Hawt!
Hootie hoo!
Psst... Hello...
Did you guys just hear someone?
Right here!
What are you doing back there?
I'm just a researcher, here to study the ruins.
But some monsters interrupted my work...
Oh. You were hiding.
Well, duh.
Anyhow, I'm so happy someone came here!
Want to hear about my fascinating findings?
Well... It might help us find Big Massif!
All right, everyone! Please take a look at the gate to your left!
This gate has a mechanism of ancient Pi'illo design!
Does anyone notice anything UNUSUAL about the gate?
Heh, indeed... No keyholes or switches to be seen, you say?
Quite right! The "key" is just behind you folks!
What're these panels for?
I believe I found the answer written on a wall of the ruins.
The Awakening Gate opens when matched symbols unite...
Matched symbols...united?
Ah! I think I get it! Look at this panel...
Maybe you need to move it to match the symbols!
That is 100% correct! Gold star for you!
Why don't I move the panels and open up the gate?
Another mystery for the ages! Actually, no, that's a lie...
I just can't lift these panels up to move them.
If we can't lift it up, then perhaps we can...
Push it up from below! You're on FIRE today, Luigi!
I'm sure you two can do it! Give it a try!
I have a feeling you're pretty close to solving this mystery...
I'll stay here ruminating on my own for the time being.
WHOA!
Another mystery of the island...SOLVED!
I must write to my learned peers!
Hmmm... We must move the panels...yet we can't lift them.
Perhaps you could burrow underground to try hitting them?
Argh, what a conundrum! I'm about to give up...
There's one less ancient mystery of this island now...
But now I have a great talking point for tourists!
Heavens! To be petrified in such a perilous place!
Phew! That was close... I might have fallen in the sea!
You two were the ones who saved me, right?
Thank you so much!
It sounds lively back there! 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
I understand that there is a "Mad Skillathon" underway.
Perhaps I should go out there and "rep" the Pi'illos!
Ah, but alas, I lack any real skills, mad or otherwise...
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
You've now rescued all of the Pi'illos!
You have our thanks, Mario and Luigi!
Let's go to Mushrise Park to tell Eldream.

Interesting...
Hitting that block cued an elevator!
That place...
A powerful dream aura emanates from there.
Huh? You mean, near the inflatable pool lounger?
This is the Dreampoint that Broque Madame spoke of!
The inflatable bed is right on the spot.
Sleep on it, Luigi!
OK, I'd better go get Princess Peach.
Oh, a dream portal appeared above Luigi's head!
We'll hide here?
That's right.
Master Mario, I entrust the princess to your care!
Try to hide her as deep in the dream world as you can.
Mario, please lead the way.
Master Mario, take care! Keep the princess safe!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
Master Mario! How fared you?
Did you hide her in a pleasant spot?
Mm hmm... So Princess Peach was an impostor, was she?
Well, excellent news. It was a fake prin—
WHAAAAAAT?!
SHE WASN'T REAL?!
Breathe...old...boy...
Insanity...
We should go back to Broque Madame's store for now.
She might be able to help us.
What is it? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world

Could this be the hidden cave?
Yes, I am getting a hidden vibe from it.
Up there! More Pi'illo text!
Hm-hmm...
It says... "Utter the code if you wish to enter."
Right, I'll just say the code written on the lithograph.
Ahem...
Pi'illo willow armadillo!
Don't look at me! I didn't make it up!
Ah, it's open!
As I sensed, this is the hidden cave!
Let's go find that treasure!
It opened?!
They're huntin' treasure!
Ooh, score!
Now's our chance!
Is it just me...or does this site feel a little creepy?
Well, whatever. We can't get in, so we should move on.
This kinda looks like a door...
But there isn't a handle or keyhole.
Let's ask around in Driftwood Shore.
Someone must know about this door.
Ugh...
DERN!
Gersh... What a dog of a day.
You fellers got a sec? I need me a vent.
There I was, levelin' the sand fer the Mole Hunt...
When DERN!
FROM THE REAR!
BA-DERSH! Like that!
Coupla ijits plow into the back of my noggin!
I lost most of my HP! Had to use a Mushroom!
Hrm? What'd they look like?
Don't recall much...
But they was definitely carryin' somethin'.
Hrm? Y'all wanna know which way them fools went?
(Hey now, there's coins to be made here!)
Sure, I'll tell you fellers which way they went...
But only iffen y'all can...
Win the Mole Hunt game!
I tweaked the game to be a mite harder'n before!
Iffen y'all win the game, I'll put you on the trail!
Heh! Y'all got yerselves a choice to make.
Look fer a needle in a hot, sweaty haystack...
Or win the Mole Hunt...
And grab that needle easy as pie!
I'ma take a powder over there. Grab me when yer up fer a game.
Awright!
I promised, so I'll tell you where them hooligans went.
Gotta say...
Ain't got a clue.
Well, c'mon, think on it, son! I was buried in the dern sand!
Both my vision and my dern FUTURE were unclear!
But!
Afore they slammed into me, I heard 'em yappin'!
They said somethin' 'bout catchin' a flight...
Sounds to me like they're headed fer a blimport.
And ain't but one blimport on the island: Pi'illo Blimport!
Gersh! I oughta be one of them detectives on TEE-Vee!
Use yonder Warp Pipe to get to the blimport!
And when you find 'em, kick sand on 'em fer me!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
Hmm... A powerful aura pulses here...
Over there! A Dreampoint!
Hey! Young'uns! Wait! Hold up!
Gersh, good to finally see a face or two...
I moseyed down here fer business, cuz a fella tole me it were a hot spot...
But I ain't seen hide nor hair of no tourists in a crab's age...

The Legend of Pi'illo Island ～Volume 1～ 
Wow, seems pretty long... Sure you want to read it? 
Don't read　      　
Read it
～Volume 1～ [Peaceful Island, Folk of Mystery]
Soft winds ever blow across Pi'illo Island, whispering of lore and legend...
A strange people once made their home here, and it is said they were possessed of a mysterious power.
What power, you ask, intrepid reader? The power to slip through the veil that separates the real and dream worlds.
These were the Pi'illo folk for whom this island is named, and under their care, it was a flourishing paradise.
But time laughs at mortal works, and now old ruins dotted about the island are all that remains.
What fate befell the inhabitants of this island? How did their line falter? Whence came their hidden end?
Consider these humble writings an attempt to record all that is known of the Pi'illos...and their end.

～Volume 2～ [Prince Dreambert]
The Pi'illos were at the peak of their prominence, and they were led by their young ruler, Prince Dreambert.
The youthful leader's crowning achievement had been the construction of Pi'illo Castle, a monumental edifice.
Though cast in stone, the structure embodied the cultural and artistic sensibilities of Dreambert's people.
As any visitor can attest, the castle still reflects both the prosperity and the peaceful nature of the Pi'illo prince.
But it reflects more. For it is said that somewhere within is a strange room... A snapshot of Pi'illo culture.
By sleeping in this room, the legend claims, one dreams of Pi'illo enemies and can revel in their defeats.
The Pi'illos were a tranquil people, to be sure...but the prince bade all soldiers hone their skills in this room.
Did young Dreambert have a premonition of evil times?
Did he foresee that some fell thing would one day come with ruin in tow?

Mr. Mario! Mr. Luigi! Hello!
It's me! You don't remember? The other day at the park...
You saved me from monsters! Am I THAT indistinguishable?!
I didn't know you guys were hitting this town next!
Say, y'know how you usually see Attack Pieces inside of blocks?
Well, here in town, I hear that guests and staff may carry 'em!
If you're looking to collect the Attack Pieces in this town...
Make sure you chat with all the people you see around.
And help 'em out! It feels good, and it might just reward you!
Mr. Mario! Mr. Luigi! What's up with that castle?!
I WAS enjoying my vacation, but now I'm kinda deflated...
Mr. Mario! Mr. Luigi! Are you looking for those Attack Pieces?
Well, gosh, you'd BETTER be! They're so useful in battles!
The hotel in Pi'illo Castle was sooooo nice...
But this inn is comfy, too! Maybe I should live here...
We've reserved the entire inn for our Toad tour group!
You think that fancy castle was just, like, a big ad for the island?
I kinda feel like I'm over it, y'know? Just over the whole castle thing.
Tooling all over the island tuckered me out, so I'm doing some reading.
Right now I'm DEVOURING this "Legend of Pi'illo Island"!
There are books on the shelf to the right! Check 'em out!
The author is a total Pi'illo fanatic!
And I heard he's in town, too!
Aaaack! I've gotta get outta here!
But I've gotta finish this book first!
The dust has settled, so I can read my book in peace now!
I need to find the second volume and tear into it!
I finally found Volume 2 of "The Legend of Pi'illo Island"!
Why are all the books in this place totally misplaced?
What if we turned the Mushroom Kingdom into a resort like this?
People could tour Peach's Castle and take photos with her!
Nah, no way. Not on Toadsworth's watch...
It'd be sick if Peach's Castle could fly like THAT castle!
Pssht, luggage?! WE'D FLY THE WHOLE DANG THING!
Did you guys hear about it? That castle got grounded!
Too bad it didn't, like, blow up into smithereens...
I heard there are tour guides in this town.
Those guys probably know EVERYTHING!
To be a tour guide, you have to memorize a lot, right?
This Legend of Pi'illo Island tome is divided into two volumes...
These seem LONG...

～Volume 3～ [The Nightmare Begins]
History teaches that time and again, across the eons, good will always be eventually beset by evil.
Evil soon came for Pi'illo Island as well. An evil born of foul parents. Its mother was corruption; its father, base cunning.
It flapped into being and all trembled! For it was the evil mage-king of bats, and its name was Antasma.
None know in what dark den it was born or what nightmare byways led it to Pi'illo Island's shores...
But once it came to roost on the island, the fate of the peaceful inhabitants was set in stone.
Though they knew it not, their sandy footsteps now trudged down the path of their own destruction.
Continued in Volume 4... [The Two Stones]
～Volume 4～ [The Two Stones]
Why had the evil Antasma come? The answer: stones. For the Pi'illos had ever guarded two precious stones.
The first was called the Dream Stone. Embedded within this wondrous stone was all the power of beautiful dreams.
There was another: the Dark Stone. And within this slept all the power and danger of the world's nightmares.
Both stones held a terrible strength, for they could fulfill the desires of whoever held them.
Antasma looked upon the Dark Stone with ravenous eyes and decided it would be his and his alone...
By insidious means and black arts, he spirited the Dark Stone from the sanctuary where it slept.
But he would not go unchallenged. Dreambert discovered the plot and led many Pi'illos to confront Antasma.
They surrounded the stolen stone, but the fiend would not yield, and the battle was soon joined.

Ah, it's so rare that I get to travel...
Spoiling myself with this huge room was worth it!
Y'know, living here would definitely be OK with me.
I've hit every tourist spot on this entire island...
But this hotel room is my favorite spot! For real!
Hi! Where did you guys come from?
Wow, the Mushroom Kingdom! Of COURSE I know of it!
There's a Mushroom Kingdom embassy in my country!
Actually... I guess you guys wouldn't know that... Ha ha!
Please, you MUST come visit our Beanbean Kingdom someday!
Our queen's beauty will leave you breathless! Ha ha ha HAAAA!
There was a huge crisis in the Beanbean Kingdom a while back...
Word was, two hairy guys from the Mushroom Kingdom saved our bacon.
Wait just a minute... Could you guys be...
Nah, that's crazy talk! Oh ho ho!
Welcome! Please make yourself at home!
Welcome! It ought to be safe indoors!
Boy, is this a nice hotel or WHAT?!
We're inside and STILL have amazing scenery!
I'm SO glad we took the time to come here!
There's a great view from this balcony, but...
Can't say I'm a fan of the crazy flying castle...
Something hit that castle, and it fell to the ground!
And I saw it all from this awesome balcony!
My goal for this vacation was to spend time in self-reflection...
So what's the meaning of life? Hmmrrmmrmrmm...
Maybe I'd better not think too much.
All right. I've gotta get cleaning right away!
After this, I've gotta cook, make the bed...
SO MUCH STUFF TO DO! I wanna go out and party!
Most of the guests at this hotel took off running!
But... There's a chance they might come back...
I'd better make sure it's all clean in case they do!
The blimport was overrun, so everyone came back!
Which means I'm mega busy... But at least everyone's OK!
The Toad just outside has been looking for something...
No idea what it is, but I hope he finds it soon.
The Toad on the roof found what he was looking for!
Boy, I'm so happy for him! It was stressing me out!
What that Beanish over there is hunting...is REALLY hard to find...
What is it? Seriously, man. I'm trying to enjoy "me" time.
I was wondering what everyone back home might be doing now...
I was ALSO wondering if our Queen Bean is doing OK...
So THIS is what being homesick feels like...
Ohhh...
Man, I wish I could see Queen Bean's smiling face...
I'm so homesick, I just don't feel like doing anything...
Huh?! That thing you have right there... Can it be... It's...
QUEEN BEAN'S PHOTO!
P-please! Can I have it?! 
No          
Yes
Oh... Oh, well, OK... It was tiny, but at least I got a glimpse...
It wasn't really enough to make me feel any better though...
Yes! THE Queen Bean! What a gorgeous smile!
Oh, I'm so happy now! Thank you so much!
I wish I could repay you, but I have nothing on me...
Oh, wait... Yeah, I do!
Here!
It's nothing great. Just something I found lying around somewhere.
You handed over Queen Bean's photo!
You got the lost camera!
I bet the person who lost that camera is looking for it...
If I'd lost something? I'd pick a high spot, like a roof...
Yeah, I'd get a high vantage and see if I could spot it.
Thanks to you, I'm gonna beat this homesickness!
Muh huh huh... Time to gaze into Queen Bean's eyes...

～Volume 5～ [The Great Battle]
The Pi'illos were fundamentally a peaceful people, and they held to this tenet as best they could.
However, with their land and culture held hostage, their fury grew terrible and they fought without mercy.
At Prince Dreambert's command, the Pi'illos hurled themselves into the fray in an all-out attack on Antasma.
None would permit Antasma's dark designs to come to fruition, even if it meant their own lives were forfeit.
For all knew that the Dark Stone, that nightmare in crystalline form, must never be used.
Yet even when the battle went ill, no spirit quailed, for the Pi'illos knew they had a powerful ally.
The power of this ally was without equal. And it stood with the Pi'illos.
It was the Zeekeeper. The bird of legend.

Legend has it that the Zeekeeper was a bird of enormous girth who watched over and guarded people's dreams.
It was massive, draped in iridescent feathers, and terrifying when roused in defense of the righteous.
The great bird lived in quiet peace as it watched over the island dwellers, but in battle, it was dire.
From its mind's eye, the Zeekeeper could launch a Wakebeam, a weapon of unimaginable power versus evil.
This weapon bedeviled Antasma in battle to the point of despair.
And so, with the help of their mighty ally, it looked as though the Pi'illos would prove the victors at long last.
As he looked upon the field of battle, Prince Dreambert awaited his chance to execute one final maneuver.
Little did he know, however, that his plan would lead to utter ruin.

As he listened to reports of the battle, Dreambert mulled courses of action.
"How can we do the most good? We must defeat Antasma, but how can we ensure this danger never returns?"
To answer his question, the prince called forth one of his subjects.
It was none other than Eldream. Long lived and wise, he knew all there was about the island and dreams.
Eldream was also the only Pi'illo who had befriended the animals of the island, with whom he shared kinship.
Prince Dreambert, in close counsel with this wise and ancient advisor, concocted a secret plan.
The plan was this: to seal Antasma deep within a dream...forever.
But could the evil one be eternally imprisoned in the dark, ethereal pit known only as Dream's Deep?

Buh huh huh huh huh! Oh hello, loyal reader! It is I, Pi'illoper, your humble author and bed lover, wrecking the fourth wall to add a word!
As my imaginary friends know, I have always had a great passion for the noble Pi'illos, and it led me to self-publish these little screeds!
Some might call it fan fiction... I snort at that! How much fan fiction has TEN volumes? Huh? Not many, I'd bet. Did you read them all?
Buh huh huh! Not to toot my own horn here, but who'd imagine I could write a masterpiece with such a dearth of historical materials?
Which reminds me, my imaginary lawyers advise me to assert that this work is not affiliated with Pi'illo Castle or any official Pi'illo anything!
All this humble author hopes is that you might read these and gain a greater appreciation for the Pi'illo folk, be the tales real or imagined!
That smell... I'd know it anywhere!
Even though it's allergy season...
I can smell that you guys have...
Pi'illo stuff!
Ahem... Sorry, guys. Got a little excited!
So let me just introduce myself.
I am the foremost living expert on Pi'illo culture.
You may call me Pi'illoper! Pi'illo-ed to meet you!
I know fellow Pi'illo enthusiasts when I see them. Let's be...
Pi'illo pals!
I bet I know why you guys came by...
It's my collection of Pi'illo artifacts, right?
Ahya! Hya hya! I'll give you a look.
But first I gotta peek at YOURS!
This guy is... Wow.
Let's show him what we've got.
I doubt you have any Pi'illo stuff that will impress me...
SQUEEEEP!

I am not worthy! Let me show you my collection!
Come!
I've opened the hidden entrance on the first floor!
Come on! Come visit my Pi'illo wonderland!
This is so crazy weird!
I know I've seen the basement entrance before!
But now...the entrance is gone.
The house's owner must have removed it.
People falling from the second floor...
A hidden entrance to the basement...
What's wrong with this house?!
Bedsmith said he would be waiting in Somnom Woods.
We should head there as soon as possible!
We must make for Somnom Woods... It is a mystical old forest.
Its location is to the east of Mushrise Park!
Let's get going then! We need to meet Bedsmith...
We need him to make that Ultibed for us!

The Pi'illo attack continued unabated. With the Zeekeeper's support, they brought Antasma to bay.
At Eldream's bidding, the beasts of the forests rose up and they, too, surrounded Antasma.
So relentless was the assault that Antasma clasped the Dark Stone fast to his chest, muting its powers.
From his vantage, Dreambert saw this and knew the time had come.
He would set his last, desperate plan in motion and attempt to seal Antasma away forever.
If it succeeded, Antasma could never cross the dream border. Dream's Deep would be his prison.
Such was the course that Dreambert and Eldream had settled upon in their extremity.
However, just as the portal to the world of dreams yawned open and Antasma's doom was nigh...
Something truly terrible happened.

Antasma was slowly swallowed by the closing portal to the dream world, and Dreambert sensed victory at hand.
But it was not to be. Catastrophe loomed, felt first by the creatures of the forest that Eldream had called.
They abandoned their circle of containment around Antasma and began a frantic retreat.
Eldream noticed something was amiss. He opened his mouth to cry out a warning, but just at that moment...
A faint sneer appeared on the lips of Antasma, hated and accursed.
Using all the terrible strength left in his vile hands, the mage-king of bats crushed the Dark Stone.
His fell body had already been swallowed by the void...
Now, last of all, his fist slowly disappeared, and Antasma was lost to the depths of the dream world.

The portal to the dream world closed on Antasma, and the Pi'illos seemed the victors at last.
But the Dark Stone had fragmented, and now nightmare chunks fell from the sky, shimmering in the darkness.
The soft bodies of the Pi'illos began hardening into stone, and one by one they collapsed onto the grass.
Before long, neither victors nor the fallen stood on the field of battle. Only silence remained.
Who knows how much time has passed since that dark day?
None know, but know this last: When all movement on the plain had ceased, a single rabbit appeared.
It bounced like a stone in the surf and then seemed to find a Pi'illo it knew from among the fallen many.
Then, as if to protect the Pi'illo, the rabbit lay against the stone, closed its eyes, and slept.
From then on, nothing marked the passage of time on the island but the silence of the stone Pi'illos.

You got a Wakeport shot!
Hey, hold up there, whiskers! What's up with the drop-in, huh?
Sorry to be a wet blanket, but you gotta come in the front, all right?
YOIKS!
Didn't even notice customers! Kylie's losing a step!
All right!
What'll it be, fellas?
You wanna know why I'm here? Glad you asked, boys!
Name's Kylie Koopa!
Ace guidebook writer for the entire island!
Eh? You think we met somewhere before?
You're sure old Kylie was a reporter back when?
Fellas, I've had so many jobs, I can't even start!
Anyway, it ain't got nothing to do with the fix I'm in!
I'm busy as a beaver and ain't got time for yakking...
Well now... Say...
You whisker boys'd be ace assistants, huh!
Give it to me straight, fellas! Help a dame write guidebooks?
You look like a coupla limp noodles, but I'm betting you got some sand!
Lookit them strong gams! Nice getaway sticks!
Hey, and, fellas, of course I ain't asking you to work for free!
It'll be my dime! You're game, you come gab with Kylie again!
If you ain't got time to help... You boys come on back later!
Sorry, but I'm busy as a hive of bees and can't slow down!
Help me out—whaddaya say? 
No          
Yes
Aw, thanks, whisker boys! I'll make it worth your while!
Job one looks like this...
SHOT COLLECTION!
See, THIS dame stationed equipment all over the place.
Named 'em Camera Blocks. Here, put your peepers on one!
This guy was in town till not too long ago, got me?
Blocks like this snap and save photos, encrypted-like.
Y'know, fellas, you might spot your own mugs in one!
Anyway, this'll be a prime warm-up for your first job!
Give that block a pop to nab a photo!
Come again? You hit a Camera Block before?
Well, that's the bee's knees! But I need to SEE it, OK?
Come on now, whiskers, let's see your best stuff!
Ritzy! That's an uppercut that says how-do-you-do!
I had a hunch about you fellas, and I was right!
Time for part two, boys! Shake a leg, now!
Hey, fellas!
Here's the straight dope, part two!
You gotta grab that encrypted shot and...
DECRYPT IT!
Camera Blocks snap shots automatically, but...
The software's kinda goofy. It encrypts 'em all scrambly!
And I gotta say, THIS dame ain't good at reassembly!
That's where you two eggheads come in!
Why don't you boys put one together?!
See, fellas? It's a breeze once you learn the ropes!
Now, I put Camera Blocks here, there, and everywhere.
When you spot a block, you boys grab that photo!
When you're ready to put it together, come back!
Look alive, fellas! Turn those scrambles into ace photos!
Thanks, boys! I'll keep my peepers peeled for you!
They're making a Dozing Sands Romantic-Oasis Tour?
Sounds interesting, but the construction will take forever...
That one guidebook said the Dozing Sands hid something...
Yeah! It said a "mystical, splendiferous treasure"!
Who writes these guidebooks? I mean, honestly. 
I was looking through this photo album when the castle appeared...
So I bolted to the blimport, but I came back to finish reading it!
All tour participants must meet in front of the clock tower!
If your tour guide leaves you behind, that's a fail on you!
Hmm... Gotta really get in the weeds and brainstorm a new tour...
Gotta be strong social... People gotta love it—send it viral!
All of the customers and the other staff ran off to the blimport...
Maybe I'll drill down and ideate a few tours for when they return!
That castle up there... Gotta say, it checks the creepy, scary boxes...
But how do I bucketize those emos to help make the next great tour?
OK, folks, we're pinging the crowd for spots on the Mount Pajamaja tour!
If you have any big asks about the tour, direct them to the on-site staff!
All the guidebooks about this island were written by the same writer...
And rumor has it that the writer lives somewhere in this town!
So... Have you met the guidebook writer yet? 
No          
Yes
Wow, you met her?! Boy! I'm so jealous!
I have GOT to get an autograph someday!
I heard she's looking for an assistant or something.
I want to go and get an autograph someday!
I hear rumors about the writer of these guidebooks...
Apparently, she's looking for someone to be her assistant.
I guess there are specialists on staff who research the ruins.
They pass info along so the guidebooks are more accurate!
When that castle showed up, I thought it was the end...
But things are all chill now. What was all that about?

Ah... I see, I see. You're dialed into Mount Pajamaja? Great.
Well, one of our key learnings is that it's a real challenging climb!
Yeah, that's a common reaction, but the mountain's serious...

You're all registered, so head for the grouping spot for the kickoff.
It's in the south of town, in front of the clock tower!
Welcome! What'll it be?
Business is business! Service with a smile!
Many thanks! See you next time!
Hoarding a ton of expensive items without using them...
Clogging up your inventory with all kinds of stuff...
I bet you guys would never do anything like that, huh?
Mario, do you have enough healing items on you?
They say there's no need to fear Bowser if you pack Mushrooms!
If you're taking a long trip, better check that inventory!
Mr. Mario! Mr. Luigi! I heard a castle appeared!
Sounds scary! Sounds like healing items are in order!
Nice! They have a pretty good lineup!
Even just window shopping is fun!
You ever really need a certain item...and you don't have it?
Yeah, that stinks! Better to prepare while things are mellow!
Hmm... Not around here either...
Yeah, I'm looking for a plush Zeekeeper, but...
It's sold out everywhere! It's crazy popular...
What... Is that a...
I wonder who might have it... I NEED a plush Zeekeeper...
PLUSH ZEEKEEPER!
My kid has been hassling me for that FOREVER!
Please, have mercy on me! Could you please...
Please give it to me? 
No          
Yes
OK... I understand... It's just too popular...
Thanks for teasing me with it... Real classy...
OH MY STARS YES! Thank you so much!
My kid is going to go ballistic over this!
I've gotta repay you! Here, take this!
I guess this is a pretty rare item, too...
Thing is, my kid doesn't give a toot about it.
It's fruit, though, and it reminds me of someone...
Someone hungry for unique flavors...in the hotel district...
You gave up the plush Zeekeeper!
You got a rare fruit!
The rare fruit I gave you earlier... Remember that?
Give that to someone you like, and it'll fire them up!
Someone in the hotel district could use some firing up...
I've gotta save up a few coins before heading back home.
When I do, though, I'll give that plush to my kid!
He is going to jump through the ROOF, I tell you!
Come rain or flying castles, we will ALWAYS be open!
Welcome to the shop!
Thanks for coming! Come back soon, OK?
CONGRATULATIONS!
Oops, I forgot...
Don't just stand there! Come on this way!
The first two customers to visit our store today...
Are our Use Badges More Often Awareness winners! 
Yeah! And you two are the first customers!
You know, I advertised the heck out of this campaign...
And NO ONE showed. Another minute or so and I would've wept...
Anyway, let's start this over! One badge lover to another!
I'll teach you a more effective way to use your badges!
Open that Badges screen!
Now you can make better use of those badges, right?
Of course, you still need to GET lots of good badges!
Anyway, enjoy the shopping!
Welcome! Can I help you find something?
At times like this, the right apparel can save the day!
Thanks for your visit! Hope to see you again!
They have a hoo variety of clothes here!
But not hoo many skirts, unfortunately...
That's pretty darn lame, if you ask hoo!
Hoo just had a brilliant business idea?! Me!
Since they only have a skirt or hoo in this store...
They should import some from a country hoo does!
I don't have any fashion sense...
And this is against my better judgment...
But I'm on vacation! I'll DO it! I'll get a mannequin!
When that castle showed up, it really shook me to the core...
It was weird... I suddenly realized we only live once!
So forget fashion worries! I'm gonna dress how I want!
Hellooo!
Perfect timing! I was just agonizing over this look.
So... How does this outfit look, in your opinion?
Do I look cute? 
So so          
Very cute
But are you serious?
But is it...beautiful? 
Very beautiful          
Decent
Is that so? Well...
Is it kind of attractive? 
I guess          
Of course
Oh gosh, I'm so happy! OK, one more question!
Do I look better than Peach? 
Equal          
Much better
OK, now I know you're just being nice... I mean, come on.
Princess Peach is incredibly gorgeous!
I gotcha...
You think I look as gorgeous as Princess Peach!
You just made my day! Helloooo, confidence!
Here you go! A gift for you!
You got a Super Candy!
I'll keep hunting outfits that make me even cuter!
Red clothes are nice, too! The color of passion!
I like yellow clothes as well! So happy and sunshiny!
Blue clothes are just cool! They help me calm down!
Um... Are you waiting for me to leave this place?
I'm fancifying myself, so I'm here for the long haul!
Who really cares about some castle in the sky?!
What really bothers me right now is...
I guess it's crazy to look for a book in a clothes store, huh?
Oh... You haven't seen it? The Book of Ruins...
The rarest of the rare guidebooks of this place!
As a guidebook enthusiast, it really turns my pages!
I scoured the shelves of the tour center, but no luck...
Maybe no one sells it? I wish I could find it...
The Book of Ruins... Where can I find it?!
I am THE guidebooker... I MUST HAVE IT!
Whoa! That book of yours! Is that... Could it be...
THE BOOK OF RUINS?!
Please! Give it to me! 
No          
OK
Oh, MAN... I'm gonna cry... At least I know it exists...
You have no idea how happy I am! Thank you so much!
This isn't much, but I've got to give you SOMETHING in return!
What do you think? She looks nice, huh?
That big, lovely smile... That shock of thick hair...
You handed over the Book of Ruins!
You got Queen Bean's photo!
All Beanish people adore Queen Bean, y'know!
Actually, I recall a homesick guy at a hotel earlier...
I bet that picture would really brighten his day!
I am so completely stoked to have this superrare Book of Ruins!
The only thing better would be to have another copy of it...
I'd keep one to display and hug the other one while I sleep!

I heard there was a big show outside...
Can't believe I missed the castle appearing!
Hey, I heard that flying castle fell out of the sky... Is that true?
A plummeting-castle event seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen.
Did hoo guys see it?
A castle appeared! Hoo! Then the nearby islands... Boom!
It was a real hoo-down of a show, I'll tell hoo that!
Did hoo guys see it?
The castle hooed right out of the sky!
Hoo gotta wonder...
Was it part of the show or a colossal hoopsie?
Hoo gotta wonder...
Was the falling castle an act or hoo?
Hoo gotta applaud the attractions on Pi'illo Island! They hoo it up here!

Oh, chéris... You have zee good timing, honh?
Hee hee... I want to show you zis thing...
Um... We're kind of in the middle of somethi—
C'est la vie! Zee road to joy is full of detours.
Err...OK?
Look at zis...
I found zis...while stretching my legs on zee beach!
It is...how you say... antique and...classy, oui?
Any madame of class... knows exactly what zis is!
Well, geez, I can't tell what it is, so...
Wait a sec. Are these... Pi'illo characters?!
What's that?
Hmm...
Those are definitely Pi'illo characters...
Allow me to take a closer look!
Ah...
I see...
What?!
Just tell us what it says already!
Pirates once roamed the seas in this region.
This object appears to contain information...
Yes! It refers to the treasure of those pirates!
PIRATES?! TREASURE?!
Indeed. As for the location of the treasure...
There is a hidden cave somewhere on this beach!
But the lithograph doesn't say exactly where it is.
There's also some sort of code to open the cave here.
A code?! What do you mean, a code?
Ah... I'm not entirely sure yet.
What if the treasure is one of the Ultibed parts?
It may be worth checking it out!
Hee hee hee...
Oui, zee passion of adventure sizzles!
Zee lithograph... You may have it!
You got an old lithograph!
We should go look for that treasure!
Where could that hidden cave be?
We'll need to comb the beach thoroughly.
Oww... Onh...
Hmm... Hit zee lower lumbar a bit harder...
Hngh... Oui, oui... Oui, zat works...
Zee shoulder... With force, honh?
Onh, onh... Oui... Bon...
Zee stress... It loosens...
Fantastique...
Hee hee hee... Au revoir, stiffness...
Petit masseurs... You are incroyable...
Hee hee hee... Ah... I have admirers, honh?
Zee severe back therapy is not for zee public... You keep zis secret?
Hee hee hee... Oui, merci...
Alors... I awaited you both...
I own zis shop, oui? I am Broque Madame.
Oui, I manage all things in zis shop... All things...
So many things, you do not care to hear, honh?
But zere was a reason I waited like zis for you...
Hee hee hee hee... Come out, vous two...
Mario! Luigi! You found us!
Since that great lout restored the Dream Stone...
We found the best course of action to be hiding.
Well, we got worried about the princess and came right away!
I'm fine, really.
But little else is...
Bowser's new castle...
Just the thought of that floating castle makes me fear the outdoors...
Oui, but zis place, it is not so safe either...
Bowser could attack here at any time, honh?
True...
Master Mario!
We must ensconce the princess in safer lodgings!
Somewhere safer... That's not so easy...
Hee hee... Well...
What about hiding her in zee dream world?
Hee hee hee... Broque Monsieur has told me of zis, honh?
And you can access zis dream world, is zis not so?
It would be zee safest place for her, non?
Well, that might be true, but...
Zere are many spots where one could sleep soundly on zee beach...
Why not enter zee dream world from one of zem and hide her?
Good sleep spots...
Dreampoints!
It would be ideal if we could reach the dream world with minimal exposure.
Good point.
Mario, Luigi... Can you do it?
Thank you!
One of zese sleep spots is not so far from zis shop...
Dear boy, send word the moment you find this Dreampoint...
We shall hasten to your side with all speed.
Hee hee hee...
Zey pulled zee wool over us, honh?
A fake princess... Incroyable...
Master Mario! I'm simply covered in shame.
I've known her all her life! And yet I couldn't tell...
Do you think we could find a way into Bowser's castle?
I mean, it's the only option! Do that, and we save Peach!
Impossible! Or improbable, at least! It's in the blasted stratosphere...
Not only that...
But it's guarded by some dratted barrier...
Waaah... Oh, waaah... Dear Princess Peach...
There must be SOME way to breach that castle...
By zee way...
Dr. Snoozemore has returned...
Eh? Snoozemore?
You saw his face at least, oui? When you came to zis island...
He is zee proprietor...
I remember him now!
He's the professor who's researching island history and the Pi'illos, right?
A learned mind, researching my people and the history of our island...
We must visit this professor.
Why?
That castle was created with the Dream Stone's power...
If this Dr. Snoozemore is doing research into such things...
He may have wisdom to share that will aid us!
Hee hee hee... Good idea, oui...
I, too, would love to meet Dr. Snoozemore...
Master Mario! Master Luigi!
Please! You must help Princess Peach!
Dr. Snoozemore, he has returned to Pi'illo Castle...
We should all head back to Pi'illo Castle right now!
How can I help, honh? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Let me know when you find zis Dreampoint...
Hee hee... I hope zat you hide Princess Peach well...
Dr. Snoozemore, he is returned...
You should meet him at Pi'illo Castle, non?
Hee hee hee... I hope you find... Zee treasures as well...
Hee... Such boredom for me zese days...
Lead the way, please.
Should you find this Dreampoint, fellows...
Do let us know at once! We shall hasten to you.
This professor is apparently in Pi'illo Castle at the moment.
Make for the castle at once!
You can go inside of someone's dreams?
Truly incredible!
Dr. Snoozemore returned at last!
I wonder what the treasure is...
What's it like to go into the dream world?
I wanna go in, too!
By zee way...
Could you enter MY dreams?
Hee hee hee... Oui, for I am so very bored...
I need...zee excitement in my life...or dreams...
Could you give me zee dreamy fireworks?
Hee hee hee... Zee pleasure is mine...
Hee hee hee... Until zee next time...
Mario, Luigi! Over there!
If they leave the cave, we'll never catch them!
Don't let them leave!
Oh... The salty scent of the sea in this cave...
I missed it so. I thought I might not smell it again.
Thanks to you, I can once again breathe deep of it!
You are princes of men. I thank you heartily!
Greetings! 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Later
It is said that this cave was once a pirate hideout.
Yes, the legends speak of a great treasure...
But what could it be? So mysterious...
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
All of the Pi'illo folk have now been freed.
My deepest thanks, Mario and Luigi!
We should go to Mushrise Park and tell Eldream.
If through the rings ye pass as a ball, then treasure—ye shall have it all.
Is this...the treasure?
This is...
One of the parts of the Ultibed!
The Driftwood Jellyfish Sheets!
All right!
TOUGH LUCK!
Led us right to it!
See ya!
HEY!
They stole the Driftwood Jellyfish Sheets from us!
Don't let them get away!
We must get the sheets back!

For confidential reasons...
I cannot permit you past here!
Nope! You have been warned!
Huh?
You exude... justice...
And mustache...
Are you Mario, by any chance?
HOOWA!
And that means this other guy with the mustache is Luigi?
He's completely inconsequential.
Mario!
Princess Peach came to this beach...
We understand it was to escape Bowser.
That was enough to make us close the beach down.
The idea is to keep any suspicious types out.
In any case, Princess Peach is waiting for you guys.
Hurry to your rendezvous!
She's this way.
This point marks the entry to Driftwood Shore.
But I'm afraid the way is closed. The beach got too crowded.
Sorry, fire marshal's orders. Just wait until it thins out.
Apparently the beach at Driftwood Shore is mobbed.
Boy, I hope we get in soon. My beany sunblock is running.
So they denied me entry earlier because it was "too crowded."
And now I can't enter because of some "need to know" garbage?
Ridiculous! Those security guys are power-tripping like crazy!
Ah, I can finally go to the beach!
Wait, what was I gonna do there?
...Dangit.
Oh! Mario!
Welcome to Driftwood Shore!
A little bird told me...
Broque Madame is apparently extra happy these days!
Yeah, I heard she found something cool on the beach.
Did you feel a big earthquake earlier?
I sure did. And that is NOT normal for here.
Giant island quakes... Can't say that's good.

夢世界クリア後から 
夢世界の中から
Ah, monsieur!
Zee Pi'illo Castle is down zis way!
Zee staff, zey await your arrival with great anticipation, you know...
Please do not get lost, honh?
Oui, hurry forward... With zee quickness... Oui.
Oh hoh hoh...
WHOA!
Full-body suit!
Lemme wear it!
Why didn't you bolt when the castle appeared in the sky?
How come you didn't break out when the big earthquake happened?
Ah, confetti in the air...
Boy, that is SO pretty, huh?
Y'know that confetti earlier?
Sounds like it was launched to welcome Princess Peach!
Talk about a welcome party. Everyone must love her!
Ohhhhhh MAN! Place is wild, huh?
There were oodles of partiers here until not too long ago...
I wonder what happened?
This guy was just telling me there was a big earthquake earlier...
But I didn't feel it. Weird.
Unbelievable! Unprecedented!
That's a lot!
Maybe TOO much!
Confetti, I mean.
The confetti's all gone now...
Sniff... Bummer...
After all the madness, does anybody even know what was going on with that floating castle?
I haven't heard anything about it since then. I feel like maybe it was a cheap parlor trick...
There was a big earthquake, huh?
First for me. Yep. Fiiiirst earthquake.
Talk about a huge welcome party!
I'm the Zeekeeper, the island's mascot!
And nooo, this is NOT a costume!
This is not a rubber suit! And there is definitely not a staff member inside!
I'm the Zeekeeper!
I never budge from duty as I watch over everyone!
(Full disclosure: I freak out and freeze when stressed.)
I'm the Zeekeeper!
I will never run from my duties as I guard this island!
(Full disclosure: I can't run. I physically can't run in this suit.)
Hi there! Welcome!
Hm? Who, me?
I'm a Shelltop.
I'm on the welcoming- committee staff.
Welcome, welcome!
Things have finally calmed down at the blimport.
Please enjoy your stay!
Welcome!
Enjoy your visit!
[The Zeekeeper Guardian] Long ago, here on Pi'illo Island, a great kingdom flourished at the peak of prosperity.
The Zeekeeper is believed to be the guardian deity of that kingdom.
Gosh! This place is like a maze!
Things seem to have settled down a bit.
Time for some sightseeing! I'm coming for you, sights!
Ahhhhhh! Pi'illo Island!
Nothing beats a briny breeze!
Wowwwwwwwwwwwww... The ocean, so very beautiful...
Snoooooooooooorffff... And the flowers, so fragrant...
Hrrrmmmrrmmmrrrrrrm... And the ruins, so mysterious...
SNAP! CLICK! BEEP!
So many pictures that just MUST be taken!
SNAP! FWA-CHEEE!
Woo-hooo!
The, uh...safety Zeekeeper advises against running in crazy circles.
Welcome!
Pi'illo Castle lies to the east.
Pi'illo Castle is east of here.
To the west is the blimport.
Who wouldn't want to hug the Zeekeeper?
He's just so soft and cuddly and huggable!
What am I gonna do if more craziness goes down?
Can't run in this suit... Might have to waddle for my life...
That was a serious earthquake...
Being immobilized in a mascot suit didn't help my frame of mind...
Welcome...to cozy, comfy Pi'illo Island!
Sounds like some of the staff kinda lost it when they saw that castle in the sky.
Huh? Who, me? You're talking about me?
I, uhh... I was chill. Maybe a little heroic.
No joke, that was one huge earthquake!
Think it'll be OK? The island, I mean...
Oh hoh!
Impressive, to see you come zis far...
I applaud zee spirit!
But zee happy times, zey end right NOW!
Now is supper time! And zee supper...is you!
Dinner? Us? What drivel!
Honh honh honnnnh...
Ah oui, for zat is why we brought you here...
You will be served to zee hongry monsters!
Voilà!
Zey are so famished! Ah, oui! Zey honger!
Dear man... You're mad!
Non! YOU are mad! And I repeat, you are...
MONSTER SUPPER!
Surely, you jest!
EEEEK!
Mais non, zis is no jest! Succumb to zee fears!
All will be monster-snacked! Zee hongry beasts will feed!
OH HONH HONH!
Princess! We must flee!
Bad monsters! No jump! Non!
Naughty! Naughty! Heel for moi!
HORP!
Master Mario!
Mario! Careful! 
What's the meaning of this?
He can't possibly mean to feed us to monsters...
If so, Princess, then we are in dire straits indeed!
Master Mario! Things have taken a turn for the rather dangerous!
I and my sturdy cohorts will stay here and protect the princess.
What say you run ahead and see what's what? There's a good lad.
Oh honh! At last you come!
I am kept waiting for too long!
Zat did not quite go to plan earlier... Non...
But zee backfire has only made mon wrath grow!
Voilà!
Zis one is stronger! Oui, and ravenous!
Prepare for nibbling!
Zis ends only when zee last morsel is snacked!
Now!
Bitez him!
Oh... Ah!
Mm? Wake up!
Now! Lazy monster! Zis is not nap time!
Master Mario! Seize the day!
Leap upon that hapless foe to begin the battle!
With luck, you'll land some pre-fisticuffs damage!
Well, zat is zat...
Zere were mistakes here and zere... But zis was quite zee spectacle, non?
This was an act?
But of course!
Zis was but one of many events prepared for vous!
You felt zee passions, non? Monster supper, indeed!
Oh, I'm so relieved! My heart almost stopped!
Honh, oui, zat is satisfactory. Now, let us continue onward!
Pi'illo Castle, she lies just before us!
We are un moment away! Come!
Ahh, looks like we shall reach proper lodging at last.
Mario, thank you for seeing us here safely.
Although... Now that I think of it, whatever happened to Luigi?
Quite right! We haven't seen him since arriving at the blimport...
Might he still be dozing?
MR. MARIOOO!
Hufff... Hefff...
I'm here with a Luigi report... He's still totally conked.
We've got top Toads on waking-up duty, but no dice.
We'll get him up eventually, though. You guys go ahead.
Tsk! Dear me... Such a slugabed...
All right, everyone, let's keep going!
Mario, please go scout ahead.
Master Mario, please! Inspect the path ahead.
Mr. Mario! You can do it!
Mr. Mario, we're counting on you!
Ahh... So, SO scary...
Err, what? I mean... 
Princess Peach need not fear with us burly Toads on the job!
We'll stay here and protect Princess Peach!
We're cheering you on, Mr. Mario! From right here!
BRIDGE OUT OF COMMISSION DUE TO STORM DAMAGE!
Sorry for the inconvenience, but please use the temporary bridge. 
When crossing, do be careful! And please try to walk softly.
BRIDGE REBUILT. CARRY ON.
You may cross to your heart's content now.
Thanks for playing! Please press  and select Close.
It's so easy to sleep soundly here!
I'm sleeping, like, 30% better than usual.
I've gotta say, I've NEVER slept as well as I'm sleeping here.
For me, I'm coming back for the sleeping, not the sightseeing.
♪Ahhh! Give a little hoooot! 'Cause I'm hooing so freeee!♪
What's better than hooing on vacation without a care?!
I'm so stoked the weather's been good.
Bad weather on a vacation STINKS.
Make yourself some memories!
Welcome, guest! Enjoy the island!
(When I don't sleep a whole lot, I get really hungry, don't you?)
(When I sleep too much, I get really hungry, don't you?)
So I've read that the structures you see around the landscape were created by the Pi'illo folk.
It's all just so ROMANTIC.
(♪Doodley! Boop! Bedooooobee!♪)
(♪Might there be snacks? For meee?♪)
Snooore... Snrrrrrk...
Hmm... Hm! Yes, I see.
Aaaaaaaargh... This is so annoying...
On a gorgeous island and I forget the camera...
Mind the unpaved ground over here.
As ever, please watch your step while enjoying the sights.
Pi'illo Island is a wonderful place to enjoy nature and ancient ruins...
You'll find very little in the way of modern construction here.
Well, except for the resort, I guess...
Take in the natural splendor of beautiful Pi'illo Island!
Mount Pajamaja lies ahead.
Hey, you two!
Oh boy. I tell ya, fellas, today is your lucky day. 
I'm selling the best badges this side of Mt. Pajamaja!
Yeah, using a badge can really make or break a battle.
So, whaddaya say?
You already got a pair!
I'm not seeing a lot of variety, though. That's a real shame.
You seem like a nice couple of guys, so I'll tell you what.
I'll cut you a deal. Just 1,000 coins for a new pair of badges.
Playin' hardball, are ya? OK, how about 500 coins?
You're really twisting my arm here! 200 coins.
100 coins. Final offer!
80 coins?!
50!
30!
10!
5!
FINE! ONE COIN!
Going once... Going twice...
...
Oh, what the heck... It's on the house.
I really gotta work on my haggling skills...
Here you go.
You got new badges!
You can equip badges from the menu screen.
Wanna know how to use badges? 
No          
Yes
First, go ahead and open the menu screen.
When you get a new badge, you can equip it like that.
Try using different badges to get various benefits.
You sure? You might learn something. 
No          
Yes
Oh, I guess that means you already know that you can equip badges via the menu.
And that you should try changing badges whenever you get a new one.
And that you should try equipping different badges for different effects.
I get new badges in from time to time.
You should stop by every now and then.
Hey, look who it is! Come to look at my badges, eh?
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
What do you need? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Many thanks. It was getting to be a bit stuffy in there.
I thought I might have to stay in there forever.
Thank you! I'll be sending positive vibes your way.
I was petrified for so long... My body is one big ache...
I need to do some yoga, loosen up a bit.
Yoga, guys. Look into it.
Nuh-uh. No way. Why is there a castle in the sky?!
What's going on with Pi'illo Island?!
Castles crashing to the ground... Princesses being kidnapped...
Pi'illo Island is really going downhill.
All the Pi'illo Folk have been saved!
We are in your debt, Mario and Luigi!
Let's go to Mushrise Park and inform Eldream!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
How goes it? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Ahh, I am free once more! My deepest thanks.
Flying castles are never a good sign.
But we of Pi'illo Tribe will persevere.
I'm told that you've been rescuing the Pi'illo folk one by one.
No matter what happens, my people are in your debt.
So, the castle has fallen and the enemy staggers!
You can do it, Mario brothers! The Pi'illo folk believe in you!
All the Pi'illo Folk have been saved!
We are in your debt, Mario and Luigi!
Let's go to Mushrise Park and inform Eldream!
Your only hope of catching that thing is the Drilldigger!
CUT IT!
You! Clod! What in the world are you doin'?!
We ain't moved an inch in hours!
S-s-sorry, ma'am!
It's just... This wall is REALLY hard and thick...
Gotta say, I think breaking through this is impossible...
SHUT IT!
Pathetic...
Oh, waah, waah, right? Can't break it, right?
Well, here's an idea for you, you giant babies.
Just go OVER it! Huh? HOW SIMPLE IS THAT?!
Just...
MAN UP!
DO THE JOB!
WHOA-YES!
Haah... This ain't gonna work...
Forget it! Just keep workin' over there!
Yes, boss!
Oh, hey, boys!
What's going on? Well, we hit a...
DEAD STUPID END!
Can't work on the far side because of this giant wall!
And I am FEELIN' some treasure just over it, too...
I wish we could just, like, boing over it or somethin'...
Yeah, right, when Goombas fly. Anyway, grousin' won't solve it.
I'm gonna stop wastin' time daydreamin' and get to work!
Ah... Wait, what? I'm back... I'm alive?
I thought I would be a desert relic forever...
That was easily the most trying time of my life...
You have my deepest thanks for saving me!
Hello! 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
There was once a crazy beast named Torkscrew in this desert...
But I don't see it around anymore. Did it go somewhere?
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes

Good job! Hope you liked the Check-X Quiz!
The event site is closed for cleaning. Sorry.
I wonder what the deal was with that castle earlier...
It was like a blimport stampede, and the floor got filthy.
And now it's a huge pain to clean it... Stupid castle.
You digging the Check-X Quiz or what?
Thanks for playing!
Pressure's on! Best of luck!
I hope you have fun here on Pi'illo Island!
Scrub-a-dubba-dubs... Squeakin' in the tubs...
Sorry, just a cleaning song I made up as a kid...
I recall it was a name that sounded peaceful and sleepy...
What was that name...
I daresay Dr. Snoozemore mentioned the name, hm?
He DID say his name on the blimp earlier, you know.
X! Gotta be X!
The guy who runs this island is the guy from earlier, right?
For a well-spoken guy, he sure passed out midsentence a lot.
Hmm, which to go with...
Well, why not X? Just feelin' that X.
Po'olo... Po'ogo... Polar... Po'ollo... Pretty sure it was Po'ollo Island...
I have no idea... what I am doing...
ｱ! Definitely ｱ!
Go with your gut!
C'mon! This is a nap paradise! So it MUST be Pi'illo Island! Doy!
I have no clue, so I'm hitching my wagon to your star.
Luigi! Were you dreaming again?!
Sounded like an epic nightmare...
YO! We arrived at Pi'illo Island! Luigi! Dude! WAKE UP!
Mm, yes... Here at last!
What shall we do first?
Welcome to...
Pi'illo Island!
We've been waiting for you to arrive!
Allow us to show you around! Let's head to Pi'illo Castle!
Wait a moment!
I understand the proprietor is one Dr. Snoozemore, correct?
Humph! Yes, well, Princess Peach traveled far for this visit...
And I must say, I find it a touch rude that he's not present to greet us.
Please, Toadsworth, it's no matter...
Ah yes, that reminds me! I should've mentioned...
Regrettably, Dr. Snoozemore is away on a business errand.
He's traveling far and wide to spread the word about our island. You know, to boost tourism!
As such, he asked that I mention that it will be a short while before he can greet you in person.
Oh...
I'll meet you just down the road!
Ooh, how very exciting! Let's go, everyone!
Hi!
I bet you know, but to move, use the Circle Pad. And to jump, press the A Button.
Also, see that icon in the upper right of the screen?
Normally, it shows the Jump icon for pressing the A Button, right?
But hold up. When you approach characters or signs...
That icon will change!
Like that! Check out your A Button now!
Pressing the button when it looks like that will make you chat with folks or read signs.
Try it out as you wander around.
Phew... Waking Luigi up is really tiring work...
C'mon, Luigi! Wake up, man!
Dude is OUT.
Don't worry, though... We'll get him up eventually.
You go on ahead with the gang!
Apparently Luigi really likes sleeping. Like, a LOT.
This is Pi'illo Blimport.
People blimp in here from all over the world!
You should've seen how busy the blimport was a few minutes ago.
That was a LOT of visitors...
You felt that big quake, right?
I heard it was an impact tremor from that floating sky castle plunging to earth.
That castle has PROBLEMS.
Well, guess I'd better get started on the maintenance.
Right bay, OK! Left bay, OK!
All systems normal!
I got besieged by requests to pilot the airship...so I did.
But then I'm like, hello? There's a giant castle floating in the air.
They don't teach that stuff in blimp school, trust me.
So, word is that some mysterious hovering castle crash-landed.
Good. Now we can fly the blimps without worrying about hitting a FLYING BUILDING.
Nice!
Always good to see the ol' airship return safely.
I LOVE YOU, ZEEPPELIN!
No! Don't you dare call this beauty a blimp! It's the Zeeppelin!
Move with the Circle Pad.
Mount Pajamaja is just ahead.
Why do people like mountain climbing?
It totally ruins your clothes!
If I wanted to ruin my clothes, I'd plant myself!
Two big sweaty guys just ran through here!
They were wearing wrestling singlets!
Who climbs a mountain dressed like that?!
I mean, seriously!
The castle is still just floating there!
Isn't it going to do some tricks or something?
I wonder where those big sweaty guys are...
I heard a big noise, and then the ground shook!
I wonder if those sweaty guys were involved...
HOO LAME!
I wanna hoo this mountain! Right now! Arrgh!
I don't give a hoo if I get all sweaty!
I just want some hoo to LET ME UP!
Hi! Welcome to Mount Pajamaja!
Great timing, tourists! There's a new Mount Pajamaja tour!
Lovingly scouted by the Massif Bros., who crested Mount Pajamaja...
This tour is only for the brave! You're guaranteed to stare down the abyss!
If you have what it takes, by all means, take this tour!
The Massif Bros. are waiting at the midway point of the mountain.
To be honest, you should have your head examined if you take this tour. It stinks.
The Massif Bros. hope you enjoy their new tour!
Pffft... No one, I mean NO ONE in their right minds would take this tour...
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
What's happening? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
FREEEEEEDOM! Thanks, guys.
Are you guys climbing this mountain?
I hope you guys know what you're doing!
There's some sort of building in the sky!
I bet it's a luxury resort. The views must be great!
I haven't seen many mountain climbers lately.
Maybe they lost their hiking boots.
I tried climbing this mountain a while back.
I failed miserably.
All the Pi'illo Folk have been saved!

We're now accepting applications for the Mount Pajamaja climbing tour!
Go to the tour center in Wakeport if you want to sign up!
- Here Lies a Hero of Buffness - Muscle Lord Benchor
Amid the sweaty furor of the Bodybuilding Siege, Benchor alone kept both his wits and his reps.
Prone on the battlefield, he pressed all who tried to cross the field into the vault of the sky.
Like an angry gym deity, he kept his core taut as he lifted foes skyward...earthward...skyward.
Here he lies for eternity, the earth a damp bench from which he will never again rise.
GAH! This mountain is begging me to hoo it!
But first I need to buy a license to hoo.
I gotta make some hoolah...
Those guys must lift. 
I wouldn't want to hoo into them in a dark alley.
Hoo yeah! Let's hoo this!
I'm gonna climb this mountain so hard!
But, um... Maybe I'll just take a hoo break first.
And you're sure this is the place?
For the last time: YES!
This is the meeting point for the climbing tour!
Uh-oh. Take a look at this.
Seriously?!
We need to go to Wakeport to register for the tour?!
Ugh, we forgot to go to the tour center!
I can't believe we walked all the way here...
Let's skip the mountain and play video games instead!
I guess we can't get through here.
Let's go to the tour center in Wakeport.
Let's move swiftly.
We can get to Wakeport by heading left through Mushrise Park.
Is climbing tour!
You climb hard. Hard like muscle.
You are tender cutlets. But climbing make strong!
When we reach top, tender cutlets are:
BEEF!
STEAK!
HUGE!
HAMS!
We've made a massive mistake...
Awesoooome...
Strong arms are strong like rock.
You train with Massif Bros., and look!
You see puny rock like this?
IS NOTHING!
We climb now!
Don't be puny!
We're finally climbing Mount Pajamaja!
The Dream Stone must be somewhere around here.
Tag along with those guys, and keep your eyes open!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
What's that? 
Tell me something 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
I'm kind of shocked that you made it up here!
Climbing this high just sounds...exhausting! Hah!
Pi'illo Island has seen better days.
No one respects the land anymore.
The gate's already open. Enter at your own leisure.
You're one step away from defeating Antasma!
Can't wait until he's gone. Hurry up! Hah!
What is it, hmmmm? 
Tell me something 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
I get fired up whenever I have to open the gate.
Really gets my blood pumping! 
Hmmmmmm... Is that a castle or an airship?
Ooh! Maybe it's a new species of bird!
You're climbing the mountain again, hmm?
Hmmm... You must be some sort of health nut!
Hmm... I wonder where that castle went?
Come!
Gate is famous spot on mountain.
Is Mighty Gate!
You are big muscles if you can open!
Even Massifs not muscles enough.
Someday, we are muscles enough!
And then we are climbing to top!
We go!
You follow!
Aaaaaaaaaaah! There are monsters around hoo!
I can't hoo this! I'm too hoolicious! They'll eat me!
You see that castle hoovering in the sky?
We're getting closer to it! We should turn around.
Did you hear that castle hoo into the ground?!
What if the impact makes the volcano hoo up?
I don't want to bathe in molten hoo, thank you.
Huh?
Where did those Meathead Bros. go?
Did we lose them?
Mario! Look! It's one of the Pi'illos!
That Pi'illo, uh... really let himself go.
Nonsense, that's simply a Mega Pi'illo!
Hm?
There's another one over there!
Mario! Luigi!
Try reviving these two Mega Pi'illos!
They may know something about the gate over there.
He's got a point! Let's do it.
Nighty-night, Luigi!
Mario! Let's rescue that Mega Pi'illo!
I got a feeling there's something here. Let's keep looking.
UNNNNHHH!
I'm back! Thanks for the rescue!
Your thanks can wait, friend. We need your help.
Prince Dreambert! Your Majesty! It is an honor!
How do you open that Mighty Gate?
You're in luck, sir. Opening the Mighty Gate is my job.
What? Your job? Are you serious?!
I am, sir.
But, uhhh...
I can't open it by myself...
It takes two Mega Pi'illos to open it.
Another Mega Pi'illo...
That must be the other big guy we saw!
I sense you are correct.
Little butter patties. You follow slow.
I thought you fall down mountain!
You must beef up. You must follow.
If you are getting lost...
FOLLOW BEEF!
Large bro, your muscles. They are ripped ham!
Small bro, you are cut like stony bologna.
Uh...
Let's go revive that other Mega Pi'illo.
Oh.
The Massif Bros. are off again...
Whatever...
That's the second Mega Pi'illo.
We can open that gate if we save this Pi'illo!
Mario, Luigi! Do your best!
HURRF!
Oh boy... Good! I'm alive again!
Thank you so much for saving me!
Great! We've revived both Mega Pi'illos!
Ah! Mega Phil!
Whoa, Mega Lowe! It has been a while.
Mega Lowe, are you aware of what is going on?
Dreambert and his friends need to pass the gate.
Oh, is that a fact?
If that is so, should we do the thing?
We should, Mega Lowe. We should do the thing!
♪MEGA MEGA PHIL♪
♪MEGA LOWE LOWE♪
♪MEGA MEGA PHIL LOWE♪
CHOOYAAAH!
Feel THAT?!
Still got it!
Oh, so I guess they do not open it... They just completely trash it... OK.
Someone opens gate?
Gate that laughed at Massif muscles?
You must be...
MUSCLE LORDS?!
Ah...no.
Not me.
Muscle Lords! Is great honor! Is like meaty dream!
I told you, we're not...
Muscle Lords of Beef! Is life's goal to meet you!
You don't listen, huh.
Ahem!
Gate is open, da, so we extend tour!
Is unknown past here! No one knows land!
Tour now separates meat from potatoes!
Da, we go! You follow!

I haven't seen many people around here lately.
No one comes to visit the hero statues anymore.
What's up with that? HYAAAAH?!
Guys! Hey, guys! Listen, guys. There's a castle... Guys, listen! Guys! There's a castle in the sky!
That Antasma is really just a rude person.
And I'm not even talking about the Dream Stone!
I heard he chews with his mouth open!
So you've finally got Antasma on the ropes?
Give him a couple of lumps for me. HYAAAAH!
Need something? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Nope
So...hungry...
You boys have any food?
Is there something major going on right now?
Please don't tell me there's a food shortage!
I haven't eaten anything in so long... I'm ravenous.
Might dirt be edible with the proper dressing?
I will never, ever, ever, EVER forgive Antasma!
Because of him, I was off my feed for a while.
Grudges borne of food deprivation are serious.

- Here Lies a Hero of Buffness - Muscle Lord Tacklecrush
Tacklecrush led the charge in the legendary Assault on Black Friday Sale Rack.
Many foes stood before him, but with a single tackle, he scattered them as a tornado.
None could overtake him as he plunged through the fray, leaving only wind and failure behind.
Rock hard were his shopping muscles, but none were the equal to the hard lock on his wallet.

SPIN JUMPING!
You see?!
Move is full of muscle. Is called Spin Jump!
Without move, mountain laughs at you!
Little sausages must master Spin Jump...
Or it is crying time! Tour ends here!
You think this can be done?
Is good, this spirit! You give this try!
First, press R Button twice to change icon to Spin Jump!
You see how A Button changed to Spin Jump?
Now, press A Button so red guy jumps on green guy!
Is good!
Next step: press A Button again to spin like meat grinder!
Is nice!
Slide Circle Pad to left and move around!
Is perfect work! Is good flexing!
Use Circle Pad while moving around, da?
That changes hover direction for you.
You learned a new Bros. Move: Spin Jump!
This move allows you to cross gaps that are too wide to jump!
Also, action icon goes back to jump if you press L Button.

This mountain was THE place for Pi'illo athletes, you know?
Yes, you'd see them climbing this mountain like ants.
That castle! It cannot be! Is that Antasma again?!
To think that he would harry us once more!
Antasma is at his evil tricks once more!

- Here Lies a Hero of Buffness - Muscle Lord Biceptus
Biceptus almost singlehandedly suppressed the Great Protein Rebellion of the Vegebrodies.
His turgid biceps were said to be infused with a divine power no amount of lifting could match.
When he swung his fist earthward, the very ground would tremble for miles at his might.
Let the legends record that no clothes would ever fit this Muscle Lord's body. Ever.

Oh, you two saved me? Oh, um... Thanks.
Many Pi'illo folk used to climb this mountain.
The view from the top is beautiful...I think.
I really don't like that Antasma guy.
I'm about 90% sure that I hate him.
I just found out that you rescued my friends too!
I'm so happy! Thanks! Thank you so much!

Valve can be turned like grill meat.

- Here Lies a Hero of Buffness - Muscle Lord Pullurp
Pullurp was the most celebrated of all athletes who participated in the Ultrapump Games.
He lifted his body up with such force that onlookers feared it would crack the firmament.
He thrust it downward with such enthusiasm that he threatened to breach the earth's mantle.
And yet, his lone failure came on the parallel bars, where the Double Glute Spin eluded him all his life.

You'll find a foul beast atop of this mountain.
It is a lazy thing, but I'd advise against waking it.
Waking the beast means waking its fury as well.
So, Antasma has returned.
I knew it was only a matter of time.
You woke the beast atop this mountain?!
I am surprised you lived to tell about it!
Antasma's days are numbered.

How is it, large bro? You have fear sweat.
But if inner beef is strong, is no problem!
Da, large bro?!
Da, small bro!
Small bro will show true muscle now, tender cutlets. Watch with eyes!
Uh... Is right of large bro to take glorious first plunge, da?
Da...or maybe cutlets should jump and we strap to back like bacon wrap?
Large bro lacks beef. Large bro is side salad.
Side salad?!
I show you side salad!
CANNONBEEF!
Whoa...
LARGE BROOO!
Large bro...
Da, small bro!
New tour on mountain is genius stroke, but...
Is no tourists coming! Is weak! Is flabby!
Small bro... Have beef! Climbing maniacs come soon!
Is supposed to be maniac tour?!
See? Faith muscle is weak. Is climbing tourists right now!
BEEF TIME!
You come for extra- beefy tour, da?
Is time to crush mountain with muscles of marble!

Ugh... It's sweltering in here! And there are MONSTERS!
What an idiotic meeting spot! No one's gonna show up here!
I'm ready to quit being a guide for this weird tour and go home...
Urgggh... So scared of heights... And of scary monsters...
No one in their right mind would come to a meeting place like this...
I'm ready to bail on this tour- guide job and head home...
I'm ready to quit being the guide for this weird tour and go home...
Incredible!
You're...here for the new tour? 
No          
Yes
That's crazy! I figured no one would try this tour...
Fine line between curiosity and stupidity, I guess!
Oh! Sorry! Forgive me!
The guides for the new tour are waiting right over there!
The footing is unpredictable, so please be careful!
Yahoo! I am DONE with this job! I got some people to the tour!
I'm going back to the tour center, and I'm gonna just KICK it!
NO ROOM!
Tour is full like sleeves of Massif shirt. No space.
YEEEARGH!
There's some fat loot on this mountain, see?
But Popple ain't really the climbin' type...
And these beef jerkies won't bring me along!
Boo! Boo, I say!
Nobody snubs the Shadow Thief, see?
I'll hit that Wakeport house for revenge!
Who cares about this stinkin' tour anyway?!
Have fun scrapin' ya knees up, ya lousy drips!
SHAKE A BEEF!
Is treasure time! We start tour now!
If you're looking for the new tour, it's along this route!
There'll be bumps, spikes, and magma on your way...
But that's just part of the island's rustic charm!
The Massif Bros. guides send this message...
"If cutlets can't reach meeting spot, they lack beef for tour!"
...Well, that's just pure gibberish. Anyway, I wish you good luck!
You wait!
No way forward, da? Nyet! We MAKE way.
We defeat gate, so we laugh at mountain!
Well, mountain laughed at us when we climb this wall, but...
We make passage through little crevice!
Da! Is time for special move!
Da!
SIDE DRILL!
Is nice! Again!
BEEEEF!
Phew... Is many reps... Maybe need break...
What?! Little tenderloins like to try special move?
Is beefy spirit!
You have eye of porterhouse! Is needed to summit mountain!
First, press R Button twice to change icon to Side Drill!
See how B Button changed to Side Drill?
Now use B Button to carry green guy on shoulders!
Press B Button again to launch Side Drill!
Is not bad! Is nice drill!
You learned the Bros. Move, Side Drill!
This maneuver allows you to go through small holes and gaps!
We keep up pace! We climb more higher!
Now open ears, little filets. Is important information.
Side Drill also breaks through hard rocks!
Rock over there asks for breaking. Is perfect practice.
Bring beef!
Is powerful, da? Is full beef, da?
Da! Muscle up! Tour goes on!
Come, lamb chops!
You got Attack Piece number 
 for Mount Pajamaja!
Remaining Attack Pieces in this area:

CUTLETS!
UP HERE!
You climb!
Is boring waiting!
Is good! Is nice!
Full of beef! We move on!!
Treasure is waiting, da!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
Huh? What happened? 
I need your help 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
YAAAAAAAAWN. Time to wake up, huh?
I don't know who you two are, but thanks!
All the Pi'illo Folk have been saved!
We are in your debt, Mario and Luigi!
Let's go to Mushrise Park and inform Eldream!
That just now... Was crazy!
Da, is true... Such crazy...
Uh! Cutlets! Is finally here!
You see there? Fountain, da?
...Is amazing.
Da, is really! You try drinking!
Da, but drink at own risk! Is crazy, what happens!
Uh uh uhhhhhh...
Uh uh uh!
Drink water from the fountain? 
No          
Yes
The fresh, sweet taste and lovely scent of the water courses through Mario's and Luigi's bodies, plunging them into a deep sleep.
In time, a pleasant smell wafts into their noses and pulls them from their deep slumber.
Lured by the wonderful scent, Mario and Luigi press forward. Their bodies feel oddly light. Their legs flex into the earth. Their mustaches flutter like gossamer in the mountain breeze. The smell grows stronger. They travel for great leagues... Or do they barely travel at all? Soon they find the smell's source.
They find endless mushrooms. An unimaginable mound of mushrooms. MUSHROOMS! Mario jumps onto the mushroom pile... Luigi leaps onto the mushroom pile... They chew and inhale mushrooms... They devour as many as they can, their banquet interrupted by no one.
They know not how much they ate. A white cloud appears beside Mario. His gloves caress the atmosphere. His soaking boots absorb the sea. Hills shrink... No! The bros are huge! They have grown as big as the island! Thousands of times bigger than life! A finger flick could smash Bowser! There is nothing for them to fear. In this moment, they are ecstatic.
Soon after that, they realize they cannot go back to normal...
In a rush of ecstatic happiness, their HP and BP are fully restored!
The fresh, sweet taste and lovely scent of the water courses through Mario's and Luigi's bodies, plunging them into a deep sleep.
After a while, Mario and Luigi awake feeling an unusual power deep within their bodies.
After becoming so powerful that they could crush anything in their paths, Mario and Luigi move on! Bowser and Antasma are still on the run, but their capture by Mario and Luigi is inevitable. All Bowser and Antasma can do now is blame one another for failure.
Bowser and Antasma are cornered with ease, but still they wish upon the Dream Stone for the bros' downfall. But of course, Luigi the superstar doesn't miss his chance to shine! He leaps gracefully into the air, and with otherworldly agility, he manages to take the Dream Stone back!
Bowser and Antasma reach the very nadir of utter failure. The bros were just too strong. Prince Dreambert revives all the petrified Pi'illos with the Dream Stone and welcomes scores of tourists to the island. Pi'illo Island becomes famous, and the party never ends.
Pi'illo Island finally wakes up from its nightmare.
Dreaming dreamy dreams fully restored HP and BP!
MARIO! LUIGI! WAKE UP! NOW!
Seemed like you were having nightmares! Are you OK?
Drinking from this fountain restores health, but also makes one dream.
Well, you guys seem OK. Let's keep moving!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
What's going on? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
It's been so long since I've seen a new face.
Stick around as long as you want! I'm lonely.
Not sure if you've seen, but there's a castle in the sky.
I doubt anyone has pointed that out to you yet.
Yep, you wouldn't even know about it if it weren't for me!
You're back! You must really like my company.
If you like me that much, you should live here!
That castle that was in the sky is gone now!
Not that I care. It's not like it was my friend.
It's so lonely up here...
Aaaachoo! 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
I think I caught a cold in the dream world.
Dream colds are the worst. Aaaachoo!
Did I hear right? Is Antasma back?
He's the one who gave me this cold. Aaachoo!
It snows around here, so it gets pretty cold.
Speaking of colds... AAAAAAACHOO!
AAAAAAACHOO! Snrrrk! Antasma is on the ropes!
When you see him, sneeze right in his face for me!
True athletes attempt to reach the mountaintop.
Beyond the gates lies a vista of divine light.
Scenery changing, da? Is reward for high climb!
Da. Good reward. Is cold on muscle.
Is strong climb, to climb so high!
If Massifs climb more...
Soon we laugh at mountain from top!
We must reach peak! Is meaty task, but da!
No way to know what waits in climb ahead!
We must flex together! Da! All one muscle!
We must...
FLEX!
HARD!
GET!
HUGE!
TOGETHER!
Is all the pumping up really necessary?
Come! We go!
Too bad we haven't found the Dream Stone yet...
Though if it's around here, it's probably at the peak.
We have to be getting close. We can do this!
Nice... A couple more Mega Pi'illos here.
It's a safe bet these guys will open the gate for us!
All right, Luigi! Conk out here!
I must say... It amazes me that he can sleep so much...
...I know! I'm jealous.
YAAAAY!
Thanks! YAY! I'm free again!
If we revive your friend over there, will you open the gate for us?
Prince Dreambert! YAAAY! You look like you're doing well!
Sure! Alone, I'm like, nayyyyy. But wake my friend, and YAY!
OK!
Mario! Luigi! Go to it!
HEYYYYY!
I feel like I've been dreaming forever and a hey...
But hey... Thanks for saving me.
If we revive your friend over there, will you open the gate for us?
Well, hey... Prince Dreambert. You look like you're doing o-hey.
Sure. Without him, I'd say nay. But with him, I say o-hey...
OK!
Mario! Luigi! Go to it!
YAAAAY! Mega Shawn! They saved you too!
Heyyyyy... Mega Cush.
I just woke, but I'm feeling YAY! Let's get on that gate!
O-hey... I guess...
Heyyyy, Mega Cush, they saved you too...
Oh! YAYYYYY! Mega Shawn!
Hey, I just got up, but let's take care of that gate...
You wanna? YAYYY! So do I! Double YAY!
♪Cush says Cush♪
♪Shawn says Shawn♪
♪Then say Cush and Shawn♪
YAY-HEY!
Yay!
Hey!
...Were the other Mega Pi'illos this odd?
Is...unbeefable!
They return...
The Muscle Lords!
These guys won't ever learn, huh?
Da.
Is time.
We will reach summit!
Is incredible time to be strong and fully beefed...
Looking forward makes muscles shake...
Da, is exciting! And so we say...
BEEF!
FOR!
TWO!
BEEF STEW!
What.
We go!
To mountaintop!
Is bad... Another gate laughs at muscles.
But...maybe Muscle Lords make smash on gate?!
Uh... Can that be... Is that... Nyet... Is impossible!
Is... Is like magic meat... Appears from nowhere!
Almost there! We go this way!
Summit close! We climb!

We must join with cutlets... Four flex as one muscle, da?
Small bro!
Da!
Cutlets! You do Spin Jump into Massif Bros.!
Spin will double, and we smash ice like muscle train!
Do not hold back! Come at full beef!
Is good! More!
No stop!
What is matter? Cutlets! Bump us!
Is good, da! We make it!
We flex like single muscle more up ahead. Da, is guaranteed.
Stay beef!
TAKE IT EASY!
If you fall, it'll be a pain to get back up!
- Here Lies a Hero of Buffness - Muscle Lord Ballance
In the war with the Dark Cholesterarians, Ballance secured victory with signature moves.
He rolled like a thunderstorm, driving his foes before him then grinding them to dust.
His vantage from atop a balance ball allowed him to keep his equilibrium in both battle and life.
And his form. His form! His sculpted body would become a template for those who aspire to buff.
You got Attack Piece number

Uh?! Wind over there...
Is strong wind. Full of muscle. Muscle wind blow us off, da?
Da, wind has beef. We avoid beef wind to pass through.
Da! Da! Is good!
We flex like single muscle! We will reach summit, da!
We go!
Ah, I forget!
If cutlets need help of Massifs, use block!
Massif Bros. come!
- Here Lies a Hero of Buffness - Muscle Lord Longbathes
The opening of the Great Sauna would never have come to pass without Longbathes.
None could match his knowledge of the bathing arts, and he was rightfully revered for it.
Claiming the temperature needed to match that of hot magma, he pioneered scalding therapy.
No one could approach his love for soaking, and so he soaks here, eternal and pruny.
W-wait!
Is bad to get so close!
Is Mammoshka, guardian of mountain. Da, must be.
I thought it was fairy tale, like legendary bacon storm...
Perhaps it is perfect final test for climbing tour...
Da, should be easy as meatloaf... Muscles laugh at Mammoshka...
Da, but remember, we have tender cutlets on tour.
We keep them safe, da? Is right thing to do.
Slow...
Slow, da...
Ah! No jostle!
Move beef!
Uh uh uh! See? Is good.
Sometimes strongest muscle is muscle that avoids fight.
Cutlets! Come! Slow! Quiet!
Phew, that was hairy...
We must be pretty close to the Dream Stone!
All right, let's go!
We're all looking forward to the new Massif Bros. tour!
Climb down the mountain to meet up with the Massif Bros.
...Is not just me, da? You saw this too, da?
Da.
Guys up there... Evil looking, da?
Da, da, was very bad guys...
Like wicked meat pies...
Is...time to give up? Forget reaching top?
Small bro! We have reached top already!
What... Da! We reach top!
UH! UH! UH! UH! We laugh at summit!
What is issue? We are at peak!
Tour ends here! Is good climb!
Cutlets are now prime steaks!
UH! UH! UH! BEEEF!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
Wake up, Luigi!
Wake up!
Look! There! A Dreampoint!
No time for that! We need to escape!
No, listen! We'll leave Luigi sleeping here and go to the dream world!
The Dreambeats cannot reach us once we pass that dreamy border!
Good idea!
Mario!
Hurry! Into the dream world!
The portal disappeared... What happened in there?
The Dreambeats made Luigi sleep too deeply.
But somehow, we found our way back out.
GAHAHAHAHA!
Wide awake now, are we?
Bowser!
The Dream Stone has been restored... SKREEKY!
Impossible!
Gwahaha! Oh, really? Feast your eyes!
This shiny rock here is gonna give us the ENTIRE WORLD!
Yeah! Hear that, cushion? It's gonna grant my wishes!
And you know who's gonna stop me? Not you guys!
SCREEETH!
Vee must start our conquest... SCREE!
Peach is in danger!
Bowser with free wishes? He'll definitely go after her!
You speak truly... We must protect her!
We need to get back to Pi'illo Castle immediately!
Wait! Be at one with waiting. Something stirs in my memory...
Yes! The Warp Pipe Block! So here is where it was hidden!
What is that?
Mario! Would you strike that for me?
What?! What is it?! WHAT HAPPENED?!
Warp Pipes...
The pipes connect in mystical ways. They shall ease our island travel.
I hid the block that unlocks them when we fought Antasma a long time ago...
Yes, I hid it here...and forgot in time. Yes. I remember it clearly now.
Are you kidding me?! Why didn't you mention this INCREDIBLY CONVENIENT THING earlier?
Ah, err... I forgot. Just... Just let it go.
In any case, the pipes should be scattered around the island now.
If my mind's eye is true, I recall one in that cave over there.
And another lies within Pi'illo Castle!
The Warp Pipe will deliver us instantly!
But listen well...
New Warp Pipes will not activate until you use them at least once.
So if you find one somewhere, use it lest you forget about it!
Well, thanks to Forgetbert's terrible memory, we've been hoofing it around for no reason...
But NOW we're in the game!
Wait, I'M the bad guy?!
Forgetbert?!
Hey! Where are you guys going?
We need to find the Warp Pipe to return to Pi'illo Castle!
Hello! Welcome to Mount Pajamaja!
You're in luck, because there's a new Mount Pajamaja tour!
Painstakingly crafted by the Massif Bros., who summited Mount Pajamaja...
This tour is not for the faint of heart! In fact...YOU MIGHT NEVER RETURN!
The Massif Bros. await hardy souls at the midway point of the mountain.
If you think you have what it takes, by all means, take this thrilling tour!
...My spiel aside, there is NO WAY anyone will take this tour. It is a tour of PAIN.
And seriously, making me lure people to some cold rock face like it's fun?
That is some nasty marketing. The tour center is remorseless.
The Massif Bros. are looking forward to taking you on a brand-new tour!
...I wonder how much longer I have to stay up here...
Over there! That's it! A Warp Pipe!
Mario! Be at one with that pipe!
Zat rhythm...
Hmmm... So much to see... I don't know where to start!
Oh! Look! It's Starlow!
Princess Peach! Toadsworth!
You were invited to the island as well?
That's right. I came all the way here to represent the Star Sprites.
HELLO YELLO!
Hoho! Hello yello, indeed! You seem as peppy as ever!
Huh?
Mario!
It's been so long! I haven't seen you since our last adventure!
I imagine Princess Peach is relieved to have you around!
Oh...
Hey, Luigi. Haven't seen you in a while either!
Of course, I'm sure it's a relief to have you here too...
I mean, I WOULD say that, but seriously...
Just... LOOK at you!
You look totally ragged! Did you get mugged or something?!
And you JUST got here! How are you so run down already?
Oh! Oh! Excusez-moi!
You have taken zee damage in battle, it seems. Oui.
Perhaps you should use zee Mushroom I gave to vous?
Ah oui! Zis idea, it is nice!
So you got a Mushroom?
OK, but do you know how to use it? You need me to remind you how? 
No          
Yes
Right. Well, first you just press START to open the menu screen.
Really? You sure? Mushrooms can be tricky. How about just a quick refresher? 
No          
Yes
OK, OK! Just don't forget to recover health when you're low!
Now zen, peoples! I must say again...
Welcome to zee Pi'illo Island!
Zis castle, Pi'illo Castle... You must walk around it.
Oui, you must touch many things... You must banter with zee staff...
And you must sightsee! Oui! Sightsee zis castle like crazy!
Zee tidbits of information about zee island, zey will sprinkle down...
Oui, and zey will guide you how best to enjoy zis paradise.
Ah, and by zee way...
Don't forget zee, how you say, gift shop?
Once you have sampled zee sightseeing, return to me, s'il vous plaît. Now allez!
Lovely! Let's tour the castle, then.
Well, hi! This is the general- info center. And how are you?
Super, I hope! Anyway, we're all about hot island spots.
Which of these sightseeing spots would you like?
Mount Pajamaja 
Driftwood Shore 
Somnom Woods 
Never mind
Oh, that? Just the highest mountain of a majestic range on the island.
You can even participate in a tour to climb it to the summit!
Oh, the fond memories you'll make! Why not try the tour out?
Well, THAT just happens to be a stretch of beautiful beaches.
For a taste of the tropics, this popular destination can't be beat!
Ah, yes. In that lush, primordial forest, the trees grow thick and leafy.
I should note... There has been very little development in that area...
As such, I can't recommend it for tourists such as yourself.
Greetings! Welcome to the general-info center for glorious Pi'illo Island!
Our humble task is educating visitors about all the great sights on our island.
What can I tell you about today?
Dozing Sands 
Wakeport 
Never mind
Ooh, this desert region is arid and unforgiving, as you might expect.
It's currently under construction to make it more suitable for sightseeing.
Many ruins and artifacts from the ancient Pi'illo Kingdom have been excavated here.
Just imagine that! History in the sands! The site continues to be studied.
For a slice of relaxing village life, this port resort simply can't be beat!
There are even events geared toward tourists, so I hope you've got skills!
It's no surprise that Wakeport is the most popular spot on the island.
My apologies... Due to extenuating circumstances...
The general-info center is currently closed...
Welcome to the general-info center for lovely Pi'illo Island!
Our goal is to teach visitors about all our island offers.
What feature would you like to hear about today?
Pi'illo Blimport 
Mushrise Park 
Never mind
The majestic blimport! Home to our blimp fleet.
The Zeeppelin, Conkstream, Snorigible, and Naptune IV...
All fine vessels capable of safe and luxurious blimping.
A haven of natural beauty, this park is lovingly pruned.
Many unusual plant varieties can be found only there...
Tourists just LOVE rare flora, it seems!
Thanks for your patronage!
Welcome to you, visitors!
This is the castle- info kiosk.
Which floor can I tell you about?
Third floor 
Basement 
Never mind
Ah, yes, the top. That would be the balcony area.
Not very spacious, true, but very popular with tourists!
Ah. Yes. Well, the basement is reserved for VIPs, I'm afraid.
Which means... My apologies...
I'm afraid members of the public are not allowed. Sorry.
Hello, guests!
This is the castle- info kiosk.
Which floor can I tell you about?
First floor 
Second floor 
Never mind
Home to the info center, gift shop, and the café!
A cherished travel souvenir... A forbidden foreign taste...
Shop! Take home something more tangible than memories!
The second floor is home to the hotel rooms.
With historic details of Pi'illo Castle perfectly preserved...
No expense was spared in creating ultimate comfort.
Many of our guests make the hotel their lodging of choice.
If I may be bold, might you consider a stay as well?
Always good to see you.
If you get lost, I highly recommend the map guide on the Touch Screen!
I feel deep shame over my fleeing behavior earlier...
But I will amend! Henceforth, I shall never leave this post!
This castle has stood on Pi'illo Island since ancient times long out of mind.
Yet you need not fear ancient amenities, for we have remodeled and modernized.
All without sacrificing the historic atmosphere of Pi'illo Castle! Enjoy!
I swore I heard a loud, terrifying noise...
And I must not have been the only one, because there was a mass panic!
Just what in the world is going on?!
Well, everyone appears to have returned.
Phew.
So, that gigantic earthquake earlier...
Should I be worried about that at all?
I wonder where I should start?
Mario. Luigi.
Thank you for saving me earlier.
A bit dated as far as castles go, to be sure. And yet, it's not without a certain rustic charm.
We're simply ecstatic to find you safe, Princess!
Master Mario! Master Luigi! My eternal thanks!
Master Mario! Master Luigi!
Do take care of the princess!
Pi'illo Castle sure has a stylish interior, huh?
Wow, looks like this place is a draw for visitors from all kinds of foreign lands.
I'm just glad that Princess Peach is safe, y'know?
Please save Princess Peach!
The exterior looks REALLY old...
But the inside is nice and remodeled! They thought of everything!
Princess Peach...
Boy, I sure hope she's safe...
This castle sure does have an air of history about it.
Yeah... Historicalistic.
Mister Mario! Mister Luigi!
This place even has a hotel!
With all the craziness that's been happening on this island, I can't believe we're still OK!
You guys are the best! With Mario and Luigi around, everything will work out fine!
What's that? You want some sightseeing recommendations?
Oh, sorry... No idea.
I just arrived from the Beanbean Kingdom, myself.
When everyone panicked before, I just went with the flow...
Mass hysteria just doesn't happen in the Beanbean Kingdom...
Hello!
Oh! From the Mushroom Kingdom, are we? I've got an eye for regions!
Me, I just arrived from the Beanbean Kingdom to do some sightseeing.
And listen, I just have to say this: Beanbean Kingdom is nice and all...
But Pi'illo Island is INCREDIBLE!
Zere are many mysteries surrounding zee Pi'illo people, oui?
Zee professor is in zee collection room.
But I bet you have more interest in zee collection zen him, non? Honh honh honh...
Everyone is overcome with charm when zey see zee collection!
Oui! Observe zem! Observe zee faces of zose who witness it!
Ho honh! Attention, peoples!
An amusing rumor has reached my ears concerning zis castle! It goes like zis...
If you sleep in a certain spot, you will meet a most powerful somebody!
Believe zis or non! Moi, I would like to meet zis somebody.
Zere may have been another... unplanned attraction outside.
If you plan on seeing other parts of zee island, tell moi first, oui?
Hold up! This area isn't ready. Afraid I can't let you in there.
Can't do it.
The hotel area is just beyond here.
But it's being cleaned. So I can't let you in.
Come back later, all right, fellas?
[The Zeekeeper Guardian] This strange bird was said to watch over the ancient kingdom that ruled Pi'illo Island.
In time, it came to be worshipped by people as a deity.
[The Zeekeeper Guardian] A tablet unearthed in the ruins had engravings describing this monstrous, legendary bird.
The tablet claims the bird is real, but none have seen it.
Your sightseeing, it is finished? 
No          
Yes
Speak to me when you are satiated with zee sightseeing, s'il vous plaît.
Very well, zen! Attention! Princess Peach and companions! 
Zere is an attraction space just ahead of here, oui?
And in it, we have prepared zee special event for vous.
So I ask zat you try it, s'il vous plaît! And enjoy!
Ouch!
Careful! Easy with the willy-nilly running!
Apologies...
I must make haste. Excuse me.
HEY!
Oh, we're back in the lobby of the castle.
Why is Dreambert in such a hurry?
Well, who knows...
If we're going to follow Dreambert outside...
I think we should probably invest in some gear.
Take a look at the map to find the shop!
Excuse me! Have you seen Princess Peach?
Come again? Princess Peach?
Oh yeah, she went to Driftwood Shore with Toadsworth.
Something about it being safer to hide there until you came back.
Go through Mushrise Park to get to Driftwood Shore.
Driftwood Shore, huh? Got it! Thanks!
Mario! To Driftwood Shore! Shake a leg!
Onh! Peoples!
News! News for vous!
Zee proprietor of zis island, Dr. Snoozemore, has returned!

From here, if you head to the right...
You'll come to the castle entrance.

Princess Peach is probably in the lobby of the castle.
Let's go check there before we do anything else!
You got the Pi'illo Castle shot!
Go decrypt the photo at Kylie Koopa's place in Wakeport!
You are Misters Mario and Luigi, correct?
Indeed, Broque Monsieur mentioned your arrival.
Please feel free to enter and leave as you wish.
Speaking of which, it's been rather noisy outside.
Is something amiss?
Weird place to put a block... Wonder what's in it...
Maybe I should stay here and stare at it for a while...
What what?!
Mmm-yes, welcome! To Pi'illo Island!
Oh my! Fascinating!
So there's a treasure sleeping somewhere in this castle!
What sort of treasure do you suppose would sleep here?
Your Majesty, please!
Step down at once! I sense calamity!
OH NO!
It took off with Princess Peach and Toadsworth!
You!
Why is there a moving rocket platform there in the first place?!
Ah! Oui!
I must tell you, back zere we found zis ancient hidden area.
Zat platform was only recently installed for zee exploring...
But it is in zee testing phase! Or at least it was...
Zee pressure of zee petit footsies activated zee mechanism, honh?
Oui! Technology, c'est magnifique!
So just what's back there, anyway?
Nothing dangerous, right? RIGHT?
I have not gone back zere myself. Non. Too damp for moi. But I hear...
Zere is something back zere, oui. Something protects zee treasure...
Great... Princess Peach and Toadsworth are in there with some ancient thing?!
It's back!
Mario! Luigi! You have to get after them, and quickly!
Make that platform work again!
Euh... Oui. Very well.
When you are ready to depart...
Just speak to zee staff, s'il vous plaît.
Ready to go to the ancient hidden area? 
No          
Yes
Then please step onto the platform.
Please speak to me when you're ready.
To depart, just speak to me.
Zee humblest of apologies...
Zee ancient hidden area was only recently discovered, so...
I do not know what awaits in zere. Non, I have pas de clue.
I'm sorry...
This platform is closed for maintenance.
Please wait until we've fixed this thing.
Dear guest, have you heard the rumor about this castle?
Long ago, a secret place existed where people would go to sleep...
And in their sleep, they would meet mighty champions to battle.
Princess Peach... In danger...
Mr. Mario! Mr. Luigi! We're counting on you!
Huh? You don't look familiar. Are you new here?
Look, the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom is visiting...
So don't do anything rude! I'm watching you, bubs.
What's the hubbub?!
WHAT'S GOING ON?!
Looks like everyone's come back.
So, guess it's back to work! GREAT.
Mweh heh heh hee...
Finally... At last...
My dream will be true! I will BE the Zeekeeper!
Oh, the shrieks of awe and delight from all!
Mweh heh heh hoo...
Broque Monsieur has been just brutal lately..
Dawn-to-dusk shifts? Who does that?
That guy's a bit much sometimes...
Telling me to "channel zee spirit of zee block"? Who talks like that?
Ahh! Excuse me, dear guests!
This place is off limits!
This area is open to staff only!
Golly! Broque Monsieur sure is amazing!
AAH! I know! He's #1 in all of Pi'illo Island!
Hey, didja hear the news?
The famous duo, Mario and Luigi, are on Pi'illo Island RIGHT NOW!
Is that not the coolest?! Boy, I hope I get to meet them!
Buddy.
You're saying I'm looking at Luigi RIGHT NOW?
Are you out of your tree?!
The real Luigi is better looking than you, guaranteed!
Now stop joking around and get back to work!
You don't want Broque Monsieur breathing down your neck!
Stop joking around and get back to work! Or Broque Monsieur will really let you have it!
There was another big crash, then everyone ran outside...
What is GOING ON?!
Enough! Everyone needs to get back to work!
There was another big crash, then everyone ran outside...
Enough weirdness already! What's going ON?!
Ah! Guests!
You're really not allowed in here!
This is the staff break room!
What... What was THAT?! I saw a castle in the sky!
That castle... It hasn't moved for a while...
But hold a moment! Dear guests!
This will not do! You should leave!
This is the staff break room.
Little help?
Can you zip me up?
Thanks! That was a big he—
WHOA!
Oh. OH. OH! Guests!
Ah! Uhh... Yeah.
You see that? You saw that.
Don't tell anyone you saw that.
Buh-KAWWWW!
I'm everyone's idol, the Zeekeeper!
TELL NO ONE!
Hey, are you guys new?
I just arrived and joined the staff a little bit ago!
Nice to meet you!
Anyway, zese mustache men, zey are totally crazy people!
You know what zey do? Zey smash blocks and turn zem brown... Oui!
Zey do not feel zee block spirit! Zey feel NOTHING! Zey are mad!
I am obligated as zee island guide, but if I were not, OH HOH!
I would say au revoir to zese two! Oui! Go bonk your own blocks!
Honh?
SACRE BLEU!
Ohhh... Messieurs...
Your mustaches, zey positively glow today!
And... And so... Euhhh...
We are counting on vous!
Au... Au revoir...
Broque Monsieur got some serious egg on his face...
Man... He got, like, an entire omelette on his face...
Quoi?! What is zee meaning of zis?
I did not hear zis attraction was here...
Welcome!
Please come again!
Hey there! How are ya? This is the Item Shoppe.
Thanks for your biz.
Hello there!
Unfortunately, we're not open for business while we restock.
I think we should be done restocking pretty soon.
Sorry for all the trouble. Thanks for your patience!
Welcome...to the Badge Shoppe.
Thank you. Come again.
Yeah, so this is the general shopping area.
Shop till you drop here!
Thuh... This... This is the... This is the shuh...shurping...
This is the shorping...area...
Ahh... That flying castle freaked my tongue out...
This is the shom...shomping... This is the shumping...area...
Forget it... That flying castle shorted out my talker...
This is... THIS IS... THE SHOPPING AREA!
Yesss... Yes! I said it! In your face, sky castle!
You can certainly tell this place is geared for tourists.
Look how much stuff they have for sale! Crazy!
So what was the deal with that castle in the sky, anyway?
Some guy even said it was one of the attractions?
Looks like that castle in the sky landed.
Guess it wasn't another attraction after all...
But...then what in the heck WAS IT?!
Ah! Mr. Mario! Question for ya!
What should I bring back to the Mushroom Kingdom as a souvenir?
Ah! Mr. Mario! Question for ya!
Looks like they're restocking this shop, and I am STOKED.
So what new things do you think they're gonna have?!
Seems like this shop sells something called badges...
Question for ya. What are they used for, anyway?
(I'm so hungry...)
(The stuff they're selling over there looks so delicious...)
(There's a castle flying in the sky...)
(I worry for the fate of the island...)
(So there was a castle flying in the sky...)
(But it was no big deal! The island's OK!)
So are you enjoying Pi'illo Island or what?
If you have ANY island questions or whatever...
Ask at the general-info center near the entrance.
The island was attacked, and I ran like the wind...
I am not the best employee... but I am a great runner!
You hear that boom outside? And the earth, it shook, I swear!
What in the world is going on out there now... Can't be good.
Man oh man oh man oh man...
Just up ahead is the hotel area.
Feel free to rest up there for a bit.
So yeah, just up ahead is the hotel area and...
... ... ...
Hey, listen, do you think the island's gonna be OK?
I'm trying to figure out if I should clear out of here...
It looks like all that hubbub chilled out for now, huh?
Great, yeah. So you know the deal. Hotel's up ahead.
Feel free to rest there.
A while ago there was all this crazy shaking... Like an earthquake, maybe?
Any idea what that was all about? Because it wasn't all that cool.
No, huh. Well, great. That's great. Oh, uhh... Up ahead is the hotel area.
ZzzzZZz... Snrrrrrrrk...
Mmm...mnfff... Mmmmyaaa...
Mrrff snrrk...
Dad! I wanna hoo out in the ocean today!
PUT A HOO IN IT!
We Hooskis don't bob in the ocean like hooby little fish!
The mountains! The mountains are the place for a Hooski!
Whaaaat... You gotta be hooing me. Not the mountains again, c'mon...
We've hooed up those mountains for, like, 10 days straight...
That pink guy!
Dude looks like a hoo of trouble...
But that mohawk! Mind hooing!
That dude is my new hoo hero!
Hoo-wee! He's chanting a spell or something!!
Monsters are gonna get us! We're hooed!
The monsters are going to hoo us right up...
That pink guy!
Dude looks like a real hoo-do-well...
This island's gone hoo-wire and this guy's hooing out...
Who...the hoo is this guy?
Who...the hoo is this guy?
(I wonder if anything tasty has fallen on the ground...)
Greetings.
A night's stay is 10 coins.
Care to stay? 
No          
Yes
We look forward to your next visit!
Excellent. We'll put you in this room right in front.
Thank you for your patronage!
We look forward to your next visit!
This is terribly awkward, but I must apologize...
You've been declined due to lack of coin funds.
We look forward to the next visit you can afford!
Are you looking for a place to stay the night?
Yes, well, you want the hotel receptionist...
Try right over there in the middle of the counter.
HP and BP fully restored!
The balcony is just up ahead.
You hoos staying here too? That's hoo, that's hoo.
Service here is incredible. They go the extra hoo!
Although...the mattress is just a hoo too soft for me.
I like my bed as solid as a Hoohoo Mountain rock!
So... You know that castle in the sky? Well... It doesn't scare me one hoo.
Th-there's no fear in a Hooski's heart. Ju-just in case you wondered...
We haven't seen hide nor hoo of that flying castle lately...
Thank hoo!
I mean... Er, uhh... Hoo. Not that I had a hoo of fear!
So that castle hooed down out of the sky...
What in the hoo was the deal with that?
Ahh, a good night's sleep... I am ready to sightsee!
Sooooooooo... Where to?
The mountains?
The mountains are no joke!
The weather up there can change on a DIME, I tell you.
You go up there in a light jacket, and BAM! Frozen.
Soooooo... the ocean?
The ocean?! Another menace!
This season is famed for its rogue ebb tides, I tell you.
You're frolicking in the surf, and then BAM! Out to sea.
Soooooooo... Town, I guess?
Into town?! Are you kidding me?!
The flash crowds there simply swallow folks up, I tell you.
You're shopping and then BAM! Never see your friends again.
Well, this is going nowhere...
Now THAT was a good night's sleep! All the brochures were true!
Since that quake...
I haven't slept quite as well... Lame.
I just can't decide on a hairhoo...
Or which pair of hoos to wear...
What should I hoo?
My wife takes longer to get ready than a wild hoo at a hoo convention...
And it doesn't matter! She always picks the same hairhoo and pair of hoos!
Hooo-de-dooooo!
I'm starting to get dizzy! I'm gonna hoo!
But the bed is just so bouncy!
I can't say hoo!
This hotel is really on the pricey side...
But I decided it was worth it for her.
And boy, it was! She's so happy!
Things sound pretty crazy outside.
Fireworks, right? Gotta be fireworks.
I know how hard he worked and saved...
All just to get this hotel stay for us.
Oh, he's the best! I was so touched!
There was a really loud noise outside...
It must be the start of a fireworks show!
Oh, I bet it's lovely!
(I haven't done a lick of sightseeing since I got to Pi'illo Island...)
(But the food here in the hotel is almost criminally good...)
(Maybe I don't need to leave the hotel after all...)
(The food at this hotel is so good...)
(So here I am... Back again...)
(This hotel is cozy. Sooooooo cozy!)
(So cozy I haven't gone outside yet!)
(I ran off to the blimport but came back here.)
(The blimport wasn't cozy. But boy, this hotel sure is!)
Whoa! You, uh... You found me!
Err... What? No! I wasn't slacking...
Oh man, thank heavens. You're just visitors!
Listen, guys, don't tell anyone I was slacking!
Again they come... Poor fools...
Look upon the ghost that haunts this castle...
My name, whispered in horror, is Smoldergeist...
Long have I wandered these dark passages...
And long have I guarded these hidden ways...
None may pass through to what lies within...
You must suffer the fate of all intruders!
Those who trespass meet...THIS!
This is not over... No.
Your doom awaits deeper within!
None may approach the revered one...
Peach and Toadsworth must have gone ahead...
This place looks sketchy... I don't like this one bit.
Let's head deeper!
Where are you going? We need to find Peach!
Where are you going? Go check that statue!
Where are you going?
Peach seems more than a bit worried.
We'd better go take a look ahead!
Where are you going?
Let's chase after this Dreambert guy!
It won't move... Broken, maybe?
Go back to the theater? 
No          
Yes
What if we make things...a bit nastier?
Ouch... Well, crud. OK, the next room...
Yes, the next will bring true fear...
Someone! Help!
That was Peach's voice!
It came from the next room! Hurry!
Peach is in danger!
Princess Peach!
Mario! Luigi!
You guys came for us! Oh, I'm so relieved...
Phew...
Master Mario... It was a close shave, to be sure!
We fled to this chamber but were surrounded...
I'm glad you're OK...
But danger aside...
This place is mysterious, huh?
True...
And that thing over there...
Such strange architecture... I wonder what it is?
Look! In front of the statue!
Check it out!
You got a rectangular rock-looking thing!
You got two round button-looking things!
Oh? Hey, aren't those badges?
Yeah, you remember those, right? They cause special effects during battles!
Let's take a look at 'em right now!
First, open the menu screen!
I'll teach you how to use a badge the next time you're in a battle, OK?
I don't really know what that rectangular thingy was, though...
What could it be, you think?
Oh my... What could that possibly be?
Maybe it's the treasure?
It kinda looks like...a pillow.
But it was here, under guard...
It MUST be the treasure, right?
Looks rather pedestrian for a treasure, I should think.
Well, OK!
We found this thing that MIGHT be a treasure...
So let's get out of here!
Mario! Luigi! Let's find the exit!
Who touches things without my leave?!
Insolent little rats! Stop your meddling!
None may lay a hand on the revered one!
Here! Pay the price of your transgression!
Arrghh... I failed...
Why...did... I...fail...
Do you think it's really safe here?
Master Mario! Master Luigi!
The princess is still concerned, so we shall remain here.
Would you mind terribly seeing if the coast is clear?
......
That statue...
Something is there... I feel it.
Please find the exit if you can.
Do you think there's a safe path out?
I'm a bit worried...
Master Mario! Your help is very much appreciated.
Master Mario! An exit, if possible.
Scout a bit ahead, if you please.
Wait... They told me the path from here was impassable! That no one could go in!
How in the... How did you guys come OUT from the area back there?
Wow! Could that be...it?
The thing people whisper might be in the castle?
The...TREASURE!
Nobody ever even SNIFFED it! How'd you get it?! And where?!
Amazing! Just crazy!
Well look, hey, you ought to just scoot on to our collection room!
That's the perfect place to display that treasure, know what I mean?
Just keep going thisaway, and you'll find the collection room!
Although there might be a monster or two around. Sorry about that.
Someone found the treasure...
Man! Crazy.
So many old-looking artifacts in here...
What is this place?
Zis is well done!
You bring back zee treasure from zee castle depths, honh? Incroyable!
Zis is zee collection room...
Oui, where we keep zee items excavated from zee island!
Collection room?
This isn't just junk?
JUNK?! Pbthhh! Non non non!
Au contraire, zee items in zis room are so very precious!
Zey all date back to zee period of zee Pi'illo Kingdom.
Oui, oui...
VIPs only in here, honh? No rabble allowed, honh?
And I say zis: Zee treasure you found...
We will display zis here as well, oui!
Huh? Mario and Luigi found it, remember?
Can't they keep it?
Hey! Luigi! Stop fidgeting.
So then this is... an ancient bed?
Oui, if you have fatigue, you can rest on zat bed.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Monsieur Luigi!
Zis thing under your head...
Zee pattern is quite ornate, oui? It may be of zee Pi'illo Kingdom...
Could it be...zee pillow zat zee prince was using?!
Zat is crazy!
Zis man falls asleep in an instant using zee treasure as a pillow!
Zis Luigi is extraordinary, honh? Zis is a man of consequence, oui!
Alors...
PEOPLES!
Please enjoy zis collection room.
Zee items, zey are super rare. You do not see zese elsewhere.
Enjoy zem all, s'il vous plaît!
[Prince's Bed] This bed was housed in the prince's room in this castle.
Note the sturdy construction and noble patterning that adorns the frame.
The delicate and deliberate craftsmanship draws the eye and lifts the spirit.
[Pi'illo Plates] These plates were excavated during development of the island resort.
It is believed that the Pi'illos used this type of flatware in daily life.
All resort construction immediately halts when artifacts like these are found so they may be researched.
As a result, some areas of the resort are taking longer to be open to the public. We apologize.
[The Guardian Zeekeeper] This legendary bird was worshipped by the denizens of the Pi'illo Kingdom.
Their belief was that the great bird protected the island from natural disasters and other evil fates.
Statues of this guardian are common across the entire island.
Their omnipresence is a mark of the Pi'illos strong devotion.
Wowzer! Amazing!
So all these things are from the age of the Pi'illo Kingdom!
Oh my! Perhaps this is the collection room?
There do appear to be many interesting artifacts...
Hey, wait!
How did you guys get in here?
We came downstairs from the first floor...
That's how. Not really rocket science here.
Oui!
It was I zat guided zem.
Aaand...
Mademoiselle Princess! So glad you are well, chérie!
HEY!
Where do you get off, acting so calm about it?
You put Peach in grave danger!
Zut alors, angry star! Relaxez-vous! Relax!
Zat was an accident! A glitch in zee machine...
Besides, you found some nice treasure, oui?
Mario!
I think something's wrong with Luigi...
What could that be?
I daresay that's coming from Master Luigi's HEAD.
Good gracious. Could it be a vision of his dreams?
No way!
Mmmm... Zis is not so crazy, non. During zee Pi'illo Kingdom era...
It is said zere were people who could enter zee dreams of others...
But why would Luigi have that power...
Perhaps it's not Luigi? What if it's the rock that's beneath his head?
Do you think that thing might be responsible for this phenomenon?
Sacre bleu! Zat might be...
It may have zee power to reflect zee dream world!
That reminds me... Where is Dr. Snoozemore, the so-called proprietor of this island?
If anyone would know about this phenomenon, it'd be him, right?
Indeed! Highly irregular that we have yet to meet the man.
We've been told he's handling some sort of foreign affairs...
But I ask you, sir! When will the fellow return, hm?
Euh!
Zat... Well, zat is something I did not wish to address, non...
We actually do not know when he is coming back, honh?
Non! No idea!
My word...
Ah, but...
Zese promotional trips, zey usually are lasting only a few days...
Oui, so perhaps he will return soon...
Ah, Princess!
It may be dangerous to approach that!
But I feel like... someone calls me...
Princess Peach! Stay back!
My...body... won't move...
EEEEK!
PRINCESS!
Toadsworth! You mustn't! Don't let it get you too!
The princess! THE PRINCESS!
Mario!
DEAR PEACH!
Easy! Easy! Mario will bring her back for sure!
Sheesh, how can Luigi sleep through this?!
Good heavens! Master Mario!
Where is Princess Peach? Where did she go? WHERE?!
Mario! How was it?
Did you find Peach?
Mercy! What now?!
The...pillow is moving!
Mario...
This is your name? Mario?
And this one here is Luigi... And you are siblings?
Hmph? What's the meaning of all this?
I am...
The prince of the Pi'illo Kingdom...
Prince Dreambert.
Th-the prince?!
Oh, oui! I knew it!
I suspected zat treasure belonged to zee prince of zee Pi'illo Kingdom...
But who could imagine zee pillow was zee prince himself? Not moi!
But why were you all petrified until now?
All was dark...
My soul's pure essence was trapped within a chunk of solid nightmare.
This nightmare chunk encased me...
My soul hung in limbo, frozen, and my body became as stone...
I could not move or speak, and my mind was unmoored...
But then came these heroes to the dream world. They shattered my prison...
And now I am one with normalcy! My mind is free and enlightened!
Whoa honh! Zis shocks me!
Zen... Zee stories about zee end of zee Pi'illo folk... Zey are false?
Oh! And...
Zee pillow rocks... Zere are rocks on zee island zat look like pillows...
Could zey be...
They can, indeed! I cannot linger!
I must rush to the others' aid!
Master Mario!
Where's our princess?
SPEAK, man! What happened?
Oh gosh...
Peach has been taken somewhere in the dream world... Unbelievable.
I wonder... This scoundrel who kidnapped the princess...
Might the fiend have something to do with Prince Dreambert?
I see... No clue...
Well, I think our only course of action is to follow that Dreambert guy!
He might know something about where Peach might be!
Master Mario! Master Luigi!
Do save the princess, hm?
Zee mind is blown!
Zee Pi'illo folk, zey still live...
Master Mario! Master Luigi!
You must save Princess Peach!
Please bring our princess back!
Princess Peach... I hope she's OK...
Dr. Snoozemore!
Mm-yes... I'm Snoozemore, the proprietor of this island.
And you must be...
Misters Mario and Luigi, mm-yes?
I have heard of you.
Welcome to Pi'illo Island!
zZz
Professor! Wake up! We need your help!
... ... ... ... 
ZZMPH!
My deepest apologies.
As you may know, I research sleep...
Clearly sleep also researches me...
Professor!
Chaos reigns over the island!
Mm?
HMMM?
I must be dreaming!
Is it... Can it...be true...
A PI'ILLO!
How...can this be?!
The Pi'illos are extinct!
Bubbitybubbity!
BLAM!
Ah, that woke me up!
zZz
Oh my gosh... This'll take forever...
Mm-yes... I see...
Much transpired in my absence...
Yes, Antasma and Bowser united their energies...
Soon after, a wicked castle appeared in the sky...
And Princess Peach got kidnapped...
Mm-yes... So you plan to infiltrate this castle?
Correct.
Once within, we could cast down Antasma again...
As things are now, though, we don't stand a chance...
Mm-yes...
Mmmmmm...
The Zeekeeper...
I'm sorry? The Zeekeeper?
That giant bird that people say lived here long ago?
Mm-yes... The Zeekeeper...
The bird of legend that lived in harmony with the Pi'illos...
Many times he protected the Pi'illo Kingdom from disaster...
If you can find that guardian...
Wait, find him?
He's around?
Mm-yes, I deem he is...
The Zeekeeper must be within the dream world...
If you can find him and convince him of your need...
Of course!
The Zeekeeper would be a mighty ally...
He wields a beam that could shatter the castle barrier!
Prince Dreambert...
You are well traveled in the dream world, I trust.
Have you seen any clues? Anything Zeekeeper related?
Something... Zeekeeper-ish?
Zeekeeper-like? Zeekeeper-esque?
Any of this ring a Zeekeeper bell?
Well... I recall something in Dreamy Pi'illo Castle...
I saw a strange statue of the Zeekeeper somewhere...
MMM!
That statue might hold the clue you need!
So it's settled! Let's make for Dreamy Pi'illo Castle right now!
MMM!
Is that a... dream portal?!
Good luck getting some info about the Zeekeeper!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
So how did it go? Learn anything new?
We are tasked with scouring the island...
We must find the five parts of the Ultibed...
ZZMPH!
And sleeping on that bed will take you to the Zeekeeper!
Is that the trzzzz...
zZz
Five parts...
Become one with the Ultibed manual on the menu screen!
Use it to find all five parts scattered around this island!
ZZMPH!
We must begin with the base... the Pajamaja Rock Frame.
It appears we can find it on Mount Pajamaja!
All right! We should head to Mount Pajamaja then!
Mm-yes? How do you fare? Was there a breakthrough?
ZZMPH!
Find all five parts... Make the Ultibed...
Mm-yes... Wait a moment. You already made the bed?!
Mm-yes... Wait a moment. You found the Zeekeeper?!
Good gracious... Wonderfuzzzz...
zZz
Mm-yes, you've smashed the castle's barrier!
You're almost there!
This room... I wonder what it's for?
It's pretty wild in here.
It's as if most of the castle has changed...
But this area remains the same.
Dreambert! Do you know this place?
Of course! 
Remember, this castle originally belonged to me!
I'll be your tour guide. Please, try to keep up!
If you enjoy a good challenge, you'll love...
The Battle Ring!
Here you'll dream about fighting fearsome foes you've encountered.
But they'll be even stronger than before.
You'll also get prizes for defeating them!
Enter the Battle Ring? 
No          
Yes
The challenge of your dreams awaits!
Very well. You may return here whenever you wish.
It is a fine place to engage in some therapeutic combat.
Welcome back! Did you find anything?
Wow! Those are gorgeous feathers!
Well, they do belong to the legendary Zeekeeper!
Legend has it that if the feathers tickle you...
You fall asleep instantly!
Once those things get made into a blanket or something...
Just think of how great you'll sleep, Luigi! I'm so jealous!
In fact, it's so comfortable, many people never wake up.
I take back what I said about being jealous.
OK, let's free our minds and look for the other parts!
Let's look at the menu for info about the other parts!
This is the last part we need. We now have them all!
Now we just need to find the master bed crafter in Wakeport.
He's the only one who can assemble the five parts!
The master Bedsmith... Yes, I remember now!
He was so good at it, he was CALLED Bedsmith.
He may also be trapped in a nightmare chunk.
Or he may be in the last place we expect him to be.
We'll need to search high and low to find him.
Enter the Battle Ring? 
No          
Yes
Like the coffee shop?
People from all over the world gather here...
You wanna know why? COFFFEEEEEEE!
This is Pi'illo Castle's famous coffee shop.
Most of these people came for the sights...
But right now their sights are on coffee!
By all means, hang around all you like.
Stay just as long as you like! Coffee-shop squatters are A-OK.
A huge castle appeared in the sky... and the barrier islands disappeared...
You should have seen the stampede! Everyone bolted out of here.
Trust me, I would've done the same if I wasn't on mug-scrubbing duty...
Tourists are slowly starting to come back to the castle.
This place will hop again soon. People can't resist the coffee!
Think of it! World travelers, all here for sightseeing!
Man, meeting new people in cool, foreign lands...
I wish I could do that!
So much wild stuff going down on this island...
Think this place'll be OK? Think I'M gonna be OK?
Hey, have you hooed this?
There's a pretty hoo beach on the island's south end!
And I hooed there's a big old mountain to the north!
Hey, have you hooed this? That castle up in the sky...
Word is, it's one of the island's hooest attractions!
Hey, have you hooed?
That castle up in the sky... It plummeted like a brick hoo!
Huh? Really?!
I don't even know where to look!
Huh? Really?!
That's good! I'm relieved!
Huh? Really?! It fell, huh?
So was it an attraction?
You hoo the Zeekeeper? The mascot of this island?
I was just talking to him! He's lived here hooever!
How hoo is that?
So yeah, this guy is nuts... That Zeekeeper mascot?
He thinks it's an actual guy who's lived here for eons...
Personally, I'm betting on an employee in a body suit...
I was told this was a hoo spot to make some friends!
But nobody's said a hoo to me since I've been here...
I guess I have to hoo my friend vibes up a notch!
This place is supposedly THE place to make a pal or hoo!
But people are avoiding me like I have a hoo in my hand...
In fact, this place kind of feels deserted as hoo.
Relaxing around here is the absolute best!
Chatting with strangers, snacking on snacks...
So what to do today? Anything I want!
(I followed my nose here. Something smelled great!)
(And just as I thought! Foooooooooooood!)
Another bluebird day! Perfect for sightseeing!
I am SO GLAD I came here to Pi'illo Island!
I am gonna write an AMAZING blog review!
This is the balcony. If that's not obvious.
Also obvious: don't climb over the rail.
Hmm? What's this? What's wrong, Luigi?
Mario! What's taking you so long?
You're freaking me out!
MARIOOO!

HELLLP!
This place...divides... the real...and the dream.
Help... Help me...
You are now...entering... the dream world...
Marioooooo!
Over there!
If my mind's eye is true... There was a Zeekeeper statue beyond this door...
Mmph...
NnnGAH!
Let us move on.
Help me! Mario!
To enter zee gate...
Vous need only stand before it and slide zee Circle Pad up!
Bon!
I see you have found Luigi, honh?
Pardon? Luigi is napping in zee real world, so he cannot be here?
Oh honh honh honh. Au contraire!
Not quite!
You are just a bit off, mon petit croissant!
You see... Zis is Luigi... but not zee real one.
Zis is Luigi as he sees himself in zee dream world.
He has named himself...
Dreamy Luigi!
Oui?
Notice zis Luigi is slightly...ah... different zen in zee real world.
A bit taller, oui. A bit more handsome zen zee real Luigi.
And zee mustache! It has zat... oomph! Zat...je ne sais quoi!
Non, it can be denied no longer! Luigi, he is...a dreamboat!
And I could be wrong, but I think he wants to help vous!
Onh! Such brotherly love... Luigi, you are magnifique!
Zis touches me!
Well, zen. Do your best to help Mario, Dreamy Luigi!
I will root for you, honh?
Au revoir, Mario Bros.!
Dreamy Luigi joined you!
From now on, Dreamy Luigi will accompany you in the dream world.
Bonjour, mon frère!
You like le hint du jour? 
No         
Yes
Ooh la la! You need no hint? Zis is impressive, honh?
Zis is no problem! We all need help every now and zen!
First, if you enter zis gate...
You appear here, honh?
Zen, if you go in here...
You arrive at zee final destination!
Does zat make sense?
If you get lost and need zee help, Broque Monsieur is at your service.
Perhaps you should try entering one of zee gates, non?
Oh honh honh! Zis room! It is very confusing!
You need help navigating zee gates, honh?
Help me!
Ooh la la! Magnifique!
But zis... It is just zee beginning!
Zee monsters will be stronger after zis!
Fight zee weak monsters first to become stronger!
You must spank zee weak ones, or zee big ones will spank vous!
Keep fighting, and one day you will spank zem all!
I know vous can do it!
Au revoir!
Bonsoir, and welcome to Dreamy Chez Broque!
Zee dream world, she is not cheap, so I must work, honh? C'est la vie...
Zis is Dreamy Chez Broque!
You need zee help?

Gear 
Never mind
Keep going... You're so close...
The nightmare chunk... Break it...
Mario!
Ahhhhhhhh... I am at one with freedom.
Are you the kind souls who set me free?
I am in your debt.
Thank you for freeing me. 
You want to know who I am?
I see. You don't know who I am...
INSOLENCE!
Ahem... I am Prince Dreambert of the Pi'illo Kingdom.
What? A princess was abducted? She's in the dream world?
Hmmm... It seems some evil befell the real world in my absence...
We must return to that world at once.
Naught remains to do here.
OK, are we ready?
Non! Stop! Wait! S'il vous plaît!
Euh... Zat was a very big fish zat got away, oui...
Zat was zee rarest of monsters!
'Ey! Vous!
Listen to zee end!
Zere is a very nice prize for beating zat monster...
Oui. For zat is zee juiciest monster in zee world!
Yes, rumors have reached my ears of this beast.
It is a rare type of monster that only exists in dreams...
It is called the Gold Beanie!
If the rumors are true, one who defeats it reaps great rewards...
I have heard tales of a coin supply that knows no end...
Another tale speaks of a piece of almost mythical gear...
But! Zut alors... Do not forget zis!
It only appears in zee dream world!
And it flees zee moment it is seen...
Oui, to defeat it, zat is like a dream in a dream...
Many have been broken trying to defeat zis...
Vous! Monsieur Mario! Monsieur Dreamy Luigi!
Perhaps you can defeat zis monster!
Oui! It is a challenge, honh? Trounce zis Gold Beanie!
Au revoir!
Well, our priority must remain the Ultibed for the moment...
But if we encounter one along the way, I say we try for it.
I sense four nightmare chunks nearby.
Each dream world has a different number of them.
Find them and shatter them all!
It's the only way to revive the Pi'illo folk!
Mario! Dreamy Luigi!
I sense we may be trapped.
OK, deep breath. Now, how do we get out of here?
Hm... Do you see that swirling tornado back there?
I'm getting a Luiginary vibe from it.
Do you remember how to control Luiginary Works?
I can explain again if you want. 
No          
Yes 
OK, breathe deep. Absorb this knowledge.
First, press the R Button to switch the action icon.
Then, press the B Button to become one with the tornado.
From here on, you require real-world assistance.
I must pass the word beyond the dream border...
I'll be right back...
The tornado blasts the entire area with a strong wind gust.
As an added benefit, it blows background objects closer.
When you're done, press the R Button to switch the icon, and then press the B Button.
I imagine you can move all kinds of blocks using this power.
But for now, let's just use it to get out of here.
Of course. I sensed that you were already enlightened.
How dreamy! I applaud your resourceful spirit!
Become one with the tornado, Dreamy Luigi.
You'll need to become one with the tornado to bring that Flying Block closer.
Remember to touch Luigi's nose in the real world to make him sneeze.
First, we must put Dreamy Luigi in the Luiginary Work.
Switch the action icon with the R Button, then press the B Button.
Very well! Onward!
You saved a second Pi'illo!
Pi'illo folk saved: 
It's time for you to go back to your own world!
Here we go!
THAT ALL YOU GOT?! WORK THAT THING!
THIS AIN'T BALLET, BUB! SWING LIKE YOU MEAN IT!
AND YOU OVER THERE, TOO!
AT THIS RATE, THE SUN'LL SET BEFORE YOU FINISH!
Hey...
HEY!
You! Guy! In the red! Mustache! You look able bodied.
You're hired! You work for me. NOW GET TO WORK.
We gotta lotta construction to do in this here desert.
This one... I ain't so sure about this one...
Looks a little soft...
Eh? You guys ain't looking for work?
THEN GET OFFA MY JOB SITE!
Eh? You're lookin' for a Dream Stone in this desert?
WAHAHA!
What are you, some kinda comedian?
I know this site back to front, and I ain't never seen that.
Trust me, that's gotta be some kinda mistake.
A wish-grantin' stone...
Hidden in this desert...
Please...
Look, bubs. My job is to whip this desert into somethin' tourist friendly.
I been bustin' my and everyone else's humps here for a LONG time.
I ain't never seen no Dream Stone...
But, hey...
I never been past that sand flow up there...
So who knows—maybe that's where your Dream Stone's at.
Good luck gettin' up there, though.
No one's been able to get past the sand flow.
It's almost like someone doesn't want no one goin' up there.
A little suspicious, you ask me.
Eh? How can you guys get up there?
How should I know? I just got done tellin' you I never been up there!
But, come to think of it...
You see those four statues?
They all got holes in 'em, right?
That seem a little odd to you?
I mean, what are those for, anyway?
Huh? You wanna look around the desert for a while?
It's a free country.
Just make sure you stay out of our way. 
Now, scram! I gotta go fire some slackers.
BACK TO WORK, SLACK-A-BUMS!
Y-yes, ma'am!
O-on it, boss!
Don't hit me!
I don't mind if you walk around, but stay out of our way...or else.
Why do all my relationships have to end like this?
I need a vacation.
I had a nightmare about Britta last night. Don't wanna talk about it.
Show 'em who's my boss, Britta!
Britta seems kinda down.
She'll cheer up after she fires a couple of us, though.
Don't you think it's dangerous for that castle to be floatin' like that?
What if it...like...falls or something?
Yeah, castles crashing to the ground are scary and all, but...
Nothing scares me more than Britta.
Get outta here! If Britta sees me talking to you, she'll dock my pay again!
Sure, Britta might be cruel and overbearing, but... Wait, where was I going with this?
Britta seems to be feeling better. You know how I know that?
Because she just fired me five minutes ago!
Wuzzat? A castle in the sky?
I don't have time to worry about that! I've got mouths to feed!
Sometimes it feels like I never leave work.
And I can't say I'm making ANY progress!
♪She broke my hearrrrrrt on Hoohoo Mountain!♪
♪Dug me a hoooooooole for a tear fountain!♪
Heh! Serves her right for working us so hard!
No, I'm not crying! There's just, uh, sand in my WAAAH!
♪I'm a wanderin' maaaaan, just tryin' to find my waaaaaay!♪
♪From the Donut Plaaaains, down to Jolly Roger Baaaaaay.♪
♪There's a big ol' castle in the skyyyyyyyyyyyy!♪
♪But castles aren't meant to flyyyyyyyyyy.♪
♪I done dug a hole in the sands that doooooooooze!♪
♪Beneath the surface my love floooooooooooooows!♪
I heard that a huge creature lives somewhere in Dozing Sands.
Apparently it can crush a boulder with a single blow. Careful out there!
We might be scared of Britta, but we have a lot of respect for her.
Man, this desert is HOT! So hot, my shell is sweating!
Did I mention it was hot?
I keep hearing loud noises coming from the sky! Is something up there?
See, I don't look at the sky anymore. Not after...the incident.
I heard a huge crash earlier, like something fell out of the sky.
Man, I really don't like the sky. Why won't it just go away?
Wh-WHAAT?!
Howza? Whuzza?! Did you guys do this?!
SOLID WORK!
And I thought you were a couple of slackers!
I better...uh...go check out the area ahead...
It could...uh...be treacherous. And...uh...treasurous!
Better make sure it's secure... And secure myself that treasure!
And that's why I'm going first!
I'M THE FOREWOMAN!
I'll call you if I need you, OK? Stay here.
Well, I'm gonna go now...
♪Gonna buy me an island...♪
♪Fill it full of gold...♪

What kind of Luiginary Work do we have this time?
This one seems to be nasally activated.
Let me make contact with the real world.
It spins!
Hmm... What can we use this for?
Right! Mario can hold on to it!
Then, we'll spin the Luiginary Work!
Mario!
Try coming to this side!
Now you're on this side!
Correct.
Remember, exiting the Luiginary Work is easy.
Press the R Button to switch the action icon; then hit the B Button.
How to break this nightmare chunk?
Maybe you should try your hammer?

This...is the Dream Stone's spirit!
This is the spot in the dream world where the Dream Stone used to be!
But because this is the dream world, its spirit is still here!
Its spirit stayed in the same spot in the dream world!
Perhaps we can ask it where the Dream Stone is!
Oh, great. Great! Who are these jokers?!
You came from the real world, did you?
Well whoopity-doo!
You wanna know where the Dream Stone is?
OK.
So I'd be happy to...
NOT TELL YOU!
Oh, it's an emergency? Great, great.
Ah, I get what you're saying... That's REALLY complicated...
Someone moved the Dream Stone in the real world.
Which makes me really drowsy and cranky.
And I gotta sleep all the time to stay moisturized.
So EXCUUUUSE me if I don't have time to help you.
And don't even think about following me! I won't talk!
That went poorly.
We have no other leads. We need to get it to talk!
Great... Uncle Mustache and El Beardo are back.
Don't you have anything better to do?! I'm tired!
And my skin is all dry and flaky from stress!
Fine...
Shaddup! Shaddup! You! Slap a cork in it!
Yaaawn. So...sleepy. Mmmmm, g'night.
Come ON! Relentless!
And now there's more of you clowns?!
Gaaaah! All right, fine!
OK. I give up. You got me.
Enough already. Geez...
I'll tell you where the Dream Stone is. It's in SHADDUPVILLE!
INSOLENCE!
Ooooooh. You mad?
Is da wittle piwwo mad?
"Insolence!" Adorable.
Ha hah! Aha ha ha!
"INSOLENCE!" Priceless!
YOU WILL PAY FOR— No. Hooo... Deep breath.
We need to teach this spirit a lesson.
Mario! Dreamy Luigi! Make that spirit talk!
Do whatever it takes! Give it a good whack!
WOWCH!
You guys are REALLY annoying...
All right. Think you can annoy a spirit?
Time to pay the price. Too late for apologies!
DRILLDIGGER ON!
 ACTIVATE! 
Whooooooaaa! That thing's huge!
Stay strong, Dreamy Luigi!
Huh? What is that?
Dreamy Luigi's body is...shining?
I sense something big is about to happen!
Are you OK?!
Dreamy Luigi!
Hmm... We might need some help from the real world!
That's our best bet!
Whoa, what's that?
Starlow!
Can you do that again?
More! Hold it down!
Time to pay!
I'll crush you!
Into pieces!
Starlow! That's enough!
Dreamy Luigi is...
Hey, big green!
You're the man!
I thought all you real-world types were small fries!
But you're a big fry! So I'll go ahead and...
TELL YOU!
So, you finally decided to talk.
But only to big green! It'll be our little secret.
C-clouds...
Rocks...a cliff...
Looks like a...
A mountain. Definitely a mountain.
A mountain? Mount Pajamaja!
What's your deal, huh?!
This is an A-and-B conversation, so SHADDUP!
Mount Pajamaja...
It's a huge mountain on the north side of the island.
Are you happy now? I'm going back to bed.
Oh, and, big green... Hope to see ya around!
I haven't had a fight like that in ages.
Maybe next time I can take on big red.
Bye.
Let's go back to the real world. Our next stop is Mount Pajamaja!

Dreamy Luigi. Would you like to be one with it?
Shall I explain how to use it? 
No          
Yes
OK.
First, press the B Button to jump.
You can move around using the Circle Pad.
Sometimes you might lose your balance.
If that happens, quickly move the Circle Pad.
That will keep the Luiginoids from toppling.
Want me to go over it again? 
No

You can already jump using the B Button, yes?
OK.
Good!
You just used a Luiginary ability!
That was a marvelous Ground Pound!
Want to do it again? 
No

Luigi!
How are you here?
Luigi in the dream world... Ah... You're Dreamy Luigi!
Well, as you know, I must hide in the dream world for a bit.
Thank you in advance for your help.
Oh? Your plan is to scout the way ahead of us?
I understand, of course. I will await you here, then.
Princess Peach...
Will you fare all right on your own? Shall I remain here with you?
Thank you for the thought.
I will be fine on my own.
There doesn't appear to be any danger in the area yet...
Understood... If you say so... Let's go take a look!
I'm afraid Bowser's minions may find us if I return to the real world.
Our only option is to find a hiding place here in the dream world.
Mario! Where are you going?! We must scour this area.
This doodad here... It seems quite odd...
Hm? Shall we yank it out?
Yes... Yes. Let's do it.
Whoooaaaa, easy on the honker, dudes!
Hey, wait... That stache!
You GOTTA be Mario. Dude! I was waiting for you!
You know who we are?
Hey, bro, I know what goes down in the real world!
Hello? I'm a Seadring. Y'know? A DREAM GENIE. I know things.
I've chilled on this dreamy shore forever! Name's Seadric.
I see... That would explain the statues of you in the real world...
Oh, those old things?
Anyway, I getcha. You guys came here because...
You wanna hide Princess Peach?
No sweat! This place isn't roomy, but it's super mellow! No baddies!
Mario?
Sorry, I got a little scared so I followed you.
I can't help but wonder... Will this place be safe?
Somewhat...but I feel it's too close to the portal to the real world.
Seadric, is there no way to go deeper into the dream world?
Nay!
Or yay!
Maybe.
A Dream Egg would let you, y'know, expand the dream world!
Like, fwooooooosh! Y'know? Dream Eggs hold MORE dreams!
A Dream Egg?
Where can we find one?
Easy. I just gotta, y'know, lay one.
Wonderful! Our problems are solved, then!
Yeah, no. It takes me, like, six months to pop one out...
We don't have that long... Isn't there any other way?
Sure, sure. A quick fix. Right. I bet my little bros could help!
Well, it's settled, then! What are we waiting for?
Yes, there's no time to spare. Where are your brothers?
OK, OK. Go find another Dreampoint in the real world of Driftwood Shore.
That'll lead you to my little bros. And my little sis. Her, too.
Soooo...yeah.
Y'know what? I'd better holler at them real quick... Gimme a sec.
Hey, what's up? That Seabury? What's up, dude. Yeah, it's Seadric.
Listen, man, this guy Mario is gonna roll by to snag a Dream Egg.
Couple dudes. Big staches. One red, one green. One fluffy Pi'illo guy.
Listen, bro, give Seatoon and Seabelle the heads-up, OK?
Sorry about that. Dude is chatty. Anyway, you're all set now!
Go find my bros and my sis, and grab yourself three Dream Eggs...
With those, we can expand the dream world and hide Peach!
Yeah... Listen, fair warning... My siblings can be annoying. 
They'll help you, but they can seriously talk your ears off.
I mean, nobody visits here, so it gets pretty lonely.
Duly noted. All right, Mario! Back to the real world!
We must find those Seadrings! We must get those Dream Eggs!
Seadric! We're back!
We brought a Dream Egg!
Are you worried about me being here alone?
Please, don't be troubled. This place is safe.
I'm a bit anxious... I'd prefer to hide deeper in the dream...
I will await you here.
You've gotta get out of here, find a new Dreampoint, and find those Dream Eggs!
Mario! Did you snag a Dream Egg or what?
Whoaaa! There ya go! That's a Dream Egg!
Lemme just shake that bad boy up to get it percolating...
And let's make this Dreamy Driftwood Shore roomier!
Hey. Listen. C'mere a sec.
You ready, bro? Let's do this.
Hook me up real quick.
Just...jump on my face.
The dream world expanded!
What a revelation... A world within an egg...
Yeah, blows your mind, right? Anyway, you can go deeper now.
You deserve a treat, too! Who likes coins and prezzies?
Yeah, take it easy, grabby. I'll go stash 'em in the new area.
I know you want 'em now, but tough. This is a deep life lesson I'm teaching.
You don't just GET stuff, y'know? You gotta earn it. EARN it.
Hey, and don't forget to grab the other Dream Eggs, too!
Be careful, OK?
It would be best if the princess waits here, just to be prudent.
Let's gather ourselves and make safe the paths ahead!
Is this the end of this part of the dream world?
Perhaps we should search this area a bit more...
Hop!
Skip!
SHAKE!

Dreamy Luigi! How unexpected.
Though it shouldn't be. You do live here.
I sense a hidden power within you. A higher plane of consciousness.
Yes... Perhaps we'll explore that when next we meet. Farewell.
Mario!
Do you see that pillar reacting to Dreamy Luigi's aura?
His imagination—Luigination— is bridging the two worlds!
We'll call these bridging elements Luiginary Works!
Come now, Dreamy Luigi! Time to free your mind!
First, press the R Button.
See how the action icon in the top right is a curly arrow?
Now, press the B Button!
Thus you establish a profound connection between the worlds.
Dreamy Luigi has become one with the pillar...
This is how the real world and the dream world connect.
Pretty dreamy, don't you think?
Dreamy Luigi, you can come out of the pillar the same way you entered it.
Can I enlighten you? 
Luigination help 
Never mind
Once Dreamy Luigi has entered the Luiginary Work...
Touch Luigi's stache on the Touch Screen and pull it.
After you pull it, let it go and watch it snap back.
Yes... I feel that went quite well! 
Do you see how the branch and Luigi's mustache move as one?
What? Your plan is to...grab this branch to launch over there?
I wonder if we could use this Luiginary Work somehow...
Perhaps it could be harnessed to help us reach ever higher...
Enlightening! Pull and release! This method will prove useful...
For indeed, we can leap ever upward as if using an elastic!
Perhaps you can reach up there if you pull the branch this far?
Impressive! Such is the power of Luiginary Works!
I trust we will see many other Luiginary Works in our travels.
Open your mind, be at one with them all, and move ever on!
Grasp Mario with the tip of the branch...
Then pull it and release to launch Mario skyward!
Just like an elastic! Give it a try!
Press the R Button to switch the action icon...
Now the B Button.
Mario!
That is from whence we came. We must go the OTHER way.
Mario! Dreamy Luigi!
One of the Pi'illo folk is trapped in this space.
His or her spirit is trapped inside of these nightmare chunks...
Mario!
I beg of you! Break the nightmare chunks and free my friend!
OK, focus yourself and start with this one here.
Good. Good!
Many nightmare chunks remain scattered here.
Break them all to free the Pi'illo. 
The number yet to be broken will appear in the bottom right. 
Mario! Dreamy Luigi! Rescue my kin!
Thank you for saving me!
My spirit quailed, but I had faith I would be saved!
Oh, my feathers! Your Royal Highness!
It's been an age!
Sire, did you trouble yourself to bring me back?
'Twasn't me, no... 'Twas Mario!
Ah, Mario! My thanks!
Hm! We are truly in your debt!
Very well, then! Back to the real world!
You saved the first of the Pi'illo folk!
Many Pi'illos remain trapped still.
If only you could save them all...
There is but little I can do for you to repay this debt...
At the least, I will send you back to the real world.

Mario, tight squeezes should now be no problem!
You can go back to normal now.
I see every action has an opposite reaction...
Hah hah hah hah!

Crouch with the A Button, then press the A Button again to jump!
You got the Dozing Mattress! It's soooo soft and fluffy!
That was pretty easy, was it not?
However...
Going back might be a bit rough.

We've arrived at Dream's Deep.
I feel like I've been here before...
Where's Dreamy Luigi?
I sense he's lost his way.
He's but a thread in the fabric of the dream world.
I'm certain he'll return.
We need to focus on rescuing Peach!
Big bro!
Let me help!
I'm not clumsy!
I can jump high!
Big bro!
You're so cool...
I fight ghosts!
Big bro! Big bro!
Let me help!
I'm not clumsy.
I can jump high!
Big bro!
Big bro's stylish...
Don't fear ghosts...
Big bro! Big bro!
Gotta help bro!
I'm not clumsy!
I can be strong!
Big bro!
You're cool...
I fight ghosts!
Big bro! Big bro!
Take me with you!
Big bro! Where's Peach?
Big bro, please take me with you!
Hey! Nobody mess with my bro!
Big bro! I can help!
Ah, all is illuminated.
This is the deepest reach of Luigi's dreams.
Luigi's emotions are swirling around here.
In a sense, this place is Dreamy Luigi himself.
The Dreamy Luigi we know may be here as well.
But there's no use in looking for him. Let's forge ahead.
I wanna go too!
My bro is the best!
Big broooooo...
Don't leave me!
Big bro rocks!
Big bro!
Big bro, big bro!
I wanna go too!
My bro is the best!
Big broooooo!
Don't leave me!
My bro rules!
Big bro!
Big bro, big bro!
I wanna go too!
My bro is the best!
Big broooooo!
Don't leave me!
You're so cool!
Big bro!
Big bro, big bro!
Mariooo!
No! NO! I-it is true...
ANTASMA!
Incoming!
So what's the deal here? You Peach's kidnapper?!
Gwahahaha! You're just a little baby bat!
I could wear you as a brooch or something!
BAM!
Seriously? That was IT?! What a total wimp!
Mario! We need to get out of here!
Let's return to the real world!
GWAHAHAHA! Good plan, toots.
Time to fight, Mario! It's MY turn to kidnap her!
It's Kidnapping Peach II... The Bowsering!
TIME TO LOSE!
Wh-what's that?! WHAT IS ON ME?!
No!
You mustn't! Antasma!
ARRRRRGH!
Geddoff bee! Right dow!
Vee go now! SCREEECH! Back to the real vorld!
St-stop it! Get...OFF!
SCREEEK! I vanted to steal Peach's power...
But I changed my mind!
You are much stronger... and evil! SCREEEONK!
Vork vith me! SCREEEP!
Blech! Say it, don't spray it, dingbat.
I don't "vork" with anyone! Get real!
End this... at once!
SCREAAARK! Silence!
I can make your vishes come true. SKEEELK!
Make you...SCREE...stronger than your vildest dreams!
Huh?! What are you sayin', batface?!
Vell, I vill give you new moves. SCREE-EEK!
Use them to crush your red and green enemies!
Hmmmm... My old moves ARE feeling a little stale.
All I ask in return is your cooperation. SCREEEK!
If I say yes, will you quit screeching like that?
You sound like a beached Blooper.
GWAHAHA! I've got bad news, Super Loser Bros.!
Big, bad Bowser's about to get even big-badder!
Antasma, no!
LET'S DO THIS!
SCRAAAEERRK! Vee vill be unstoppable!
Nuisances! Vaste them!
Ooh...OH?!
GWAAAAA!
Oooooohhh!
Vell? How does it feel to be all powerful? SKRRICK!
BWAHAHAHAHA!
OH YEAH!
I could get used to this! You got yourself a deal!
SCREEARCH! We fly! To the real vorld!
My dark plan unfolds... MWAHAHEEEESK!
Hold it, guy!
I came here to kidnap Peach, remember?
Vee can take the girl anytime...
But vee must stick to the plan for now...
Ugh... Fine!
Mario!
I'll be back for Peach!
Don't let anyone else kidnap her until I get back!
Grab on. SCREEESHK!
HEEYAAAA!
Hmm... An interesting situation indeed.
Clearly at some cost, for they all sleep now.
It's dangerous to fall asleep in a dream.
Ah! That must be Princess Peach.
These boys managed to save you, did they?
Well, I have little choice... I will take you to the real world.
There it is, as in memory... The Zeekeeper statue...
Ah, yes! I remember now.
I was still so young when it came to pass...
Yes, long ago I entered Dream's Deep.
It was here that I learned to summon the Zeekeeper.
It is not easy to call him forth...
When I was here as a youth, I had no idea where to begin.
And though I have met the Zeekeeper in the real world...
I am afraid that I do not recall...how to summon him...
Hmm...
I sense this statue holds the Zeekeeper's secret, but...
Well, let us investigate the area a bit first...
These symbols are... Pi'illo characters.
"All those...who seek... the Zeekeeper's power..."
"Ulti...bed..."
"You must make the Ultibed..."
"The Ultibed..."
"It is constructed of five parts..."
"The Pajamaja Rock Frame... It rests on Mount Pajamaja."
"The Dozing Mattress... sleeps in Dozing Sands."
"The Mushrise Tree Board... rises in Mushrise Fields."
"Driftwood Jellyfish Sheets... drift on Driftwood Shore."
"The Zeekeeper's Feathers... An heirloom of Pi'illo Castle."
"All five parts must be assembled by a Bedsmith."
"The Bedsmiths will gather on Wake Isle."
"Find the five parts, and give them to a Bedsmith."
"Only then can the Ultibed be completed..."
Mushrise Fields... That surely refers to Mushrise Park.
And Wake Isle must be Wakeport. Do you agree?
This is...
Ah, this pamphlet holds all the information I just translated.
Mario...will you hang on to it?
You got the Ultibed manual!
I sense that if Luigi sleeps on the Ultibed...
We will find the dream world where the Zeekeeper lingers.
You can check the manual I gave you from the menu.
Be at one with it, and find all five parts!
You can use Luigination in a place like this?!
But...there does not seem to be room to maneuver.
What? Your mind has opened to yet another new shape?
Whoa! A ball!
Can you move around using the Circle Pad?
Hah hah hah!
Look at you— on a roll!
Dreamy! With this shape, exploring will be a snap!
Just a reminder, but to switch the icon, you must press the R Button, OK?
To return to normal, press the L Button to collapse and then hit the B Button.
A dead end...
I sense something...
Might you be able to use your new shape somehow?
Whoa!
Wonderful!
Pressing the B Button pops out a string of Luiginoids!
Dreamy!
You learned a new move!
I sense that if you want to let go, you can press the A Button.
You learned the Hookshot!
Press the B Button while in ball form to aim, and press the B Button again to launch!
Ugh... Stuck.
Mario... What are you doing?
What... TRULY?!
If you press the A Button, you can swing the Luiginary Ball!
Perhaps... If you press the A Button again...
Hah hah hah!
Is there no end to your powers?!
Shall we call it the Ball Hammer?
Let us break those as well.
Can you aim lower and then hurl it?
Nothing can stop us now!
Onward!
You learned the Ball Hammer!
Press the A Button to swing the ball, and press the A Button again to hurl it!
While you're swinging the ball, use the Circle Pad to move up and down!
Who...disturbs my rest?
I am the legendary Zeekeeper... The guardian of the Pi'illo Kingdom...
Those who hinder me will become one with the light!
Wait! Zeekeep—
You fought well!
I am the Zeekeeper...
The bird of legend... Protector of Pi'illo Island...
You have come far to rouse me from sleep...
Do events go ill in the real world?
Zeekeeper!
Pi'illo Island is in danger once again!
Oh, DUDE! What is UP! It's been forever!
Dreambert! My man!
Why didn't you speak up? Totally didn't notice you!
Yes... This is what the Zeekeeper is REALLY like.
At first, he seems a bit... standoffish, but hey.
Did you just describe me as a bit standoffish?
How about you stand off that branch over there?
Hahaha! Just kidding! Good ol' Dreambert!
Anyway, what're you guys doing here?
Antasma again? UGGGGGGH.
There's something so wrong with him.
It's more than just the island... He aims to conquer the world!
No kidding? For real. Weak. SOOO weak.
Dude just refuses to learn his lesson, huh?
Oh, gotcha. Big ol' barrier around their castle, huh?
This Bowser guy sounds like another nut job.
Such is the reason we came, Zeekeeper. We need your help.
Ah. Did you. Look, Prince... Not gonna happen, bro.
But, Zeekeeper! With your power, you could smash the castle barrier!
Yeah, BEFORE. But I retired. I'm old and tired now.
Butter me up all you want, but this bird ain't budging.
Unless...I got a bit of THAT. You know what I mean!
What? What are you talking about?
Oh, you don't know? Guess we're done, then.
Take off, guys.
Oh, I get it! Coins, right?
Man, SHUSH! Poor form! Not in front of everyone!
But...yeah, coins. How many? How much you gonna pay?
How about this? If we can get the island back to normal, my friend Mario here...
He will give you every single coin he has...
All of them...
Yes! Every last coin we have!
Just bear with me for now...
Whoa, you for real? No joke?
If you ask THAT nicely, I can help, but...
Let's go over this. Antasma's back. Working with some Bowser guy...
Weird flying castle... Check. Barrier to be smashed... Check.
That alone carries serious labor costs!
And! Gotta get insurance. That's gonna be pricey...
Gonna need a travel budget... Hotel bill... Complimentary robe...
High-end meal... In-flight snacks... Stipend for massages and leisure...
There's also that...and THAT... Ah! At least four of those...
My friends need souvenirs... I've had my eye on that one thing...
Done! It's rough, but I think I've got a working estimate!
I'll just round up for convenience... It'll be only 80,000,000 coins!
When all is said and done, this bill comes due.
That gonna work for you? It's some serious dough.
This is MARIO over here! It'll be a piece of cake!
DIDN'T ASK YOU, DREAMBERT!
Mario... Little guy... Well? Can you pay?
Sweet!
No backsies! You promised!
Let's imprison Antasma again and bring peace to Pi'illo Island!
OK then, little dude! Hop onto my back!
I'll waive the fee for this ride.
Up we gooo!
Big bro in danger!
Must help big bro!
Gotta help bro!
Big bro!
BRO!
Big bro!
Irritating...
SCRAW!
Once more!
Da!
Large bro... Is impossible!
Go through ring without touching?!
Is salad talk! Is weak! You give up on tour?
Maybe jump must be soft like this...
Large bro, is stupid pose. Is like eggs without bacon.
Uh... Cutlets...
What was Massif doing? Is important work...
Way to treasure is behind door. Is theory, anyway...
But door stay closed! Is real brain buster!
Ring seems like key, but no. Massif failure.
But maybe small muscles mean big heads, da?
If cutlets open door, then they keep mountain treasure!
Massif Bros. help! Head muscles FLEX!
Mysterious ring... Da, is begging for jumping through...
But one little touch of muscle, and it disappears like ghost ham.
Uh... Ring connects to door, da, but how...
"Through ring, through door. Be the key within the keyhole!"
This is legend of mountain. Is hint about door, but...
Too many brain reps making head hurt! Can't figure out!
UNBEBEEFABLE!
Door opens!
We knew little cutlets had inner beef!
But who knew cutlets were mountain maniacs?!
Massif Bros. give respect with meaty gift!
Is mystery to us, past this point...
But treasure must be near, da?!
Da! Come!
You got all 10 Massif Bros. Attack Pieces at once!
You learned a new Bros. Attack!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
How can I help? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Oh yeah! I am BACK!
You are incredible! You are heroes!
And so you deserve this mighty gift!
You got a Dozite!
Well done! You saved the other gatekeepers too?!
That means the path to the Dream Stone is now open!
You must do me this one favor.
You must check on the Dream Stone.
No one has checked on it for ages.
I know not why... but I smell horrid.
And I am sticky. Why am I sticky?
That evil Antasma! Making such a weapon!
It fills me with rage! And I STILL smell!
I smell the foul stench of Antasma even here!
Oh, wait...No, that... That is just my stench.
Soon you will wash the evil of Antasma away.
If only you could wash the stink off of me!
Did you see that?! It spat the pillow out!
Let's use that spot to go to the dream world!
Oh, it's, um... covered in drool.
And...it smells like garlic.
Well... Sweet dreams, Luigi!
Don't be such a baby!
GOOD NIGHT!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
BOSS LADY!
Britta!
Uggggh... Why... Blinded by greed...
There ain't even treasure here...
I was a fool...
No! Britta! Don't yap! Save your energy!
You guys... Thank you...
Take over...for me... Fire...everyon—
BRITTA, NOOOO!
I ain't dead! Get over here and pick me up!
Roger that! Someone call a doctor!
She probably lost a coin or two, but she'll be fine.
The Dream Stone is right over there!
Let's go!
Huh? What?! There's nothing here!
What's going on?
GWAHAHAHA!
Too late, chumps!
No! That's...the Dream Stone!
SCREEE! Vee meet again, Dreambert...
Vell, I could not steal the Dark Stone...
So this Dream Stone vill have to do!
I vill not be defeated again! SCRAAAEEK!
Antasma! You coward!
GAH!
Gotta hand it to 'em—they know how to make an exit!
Hurry! We must pursue!
Cool it, princey! No one likes a hot pillow.
We don't even know where they ran off to!
Hmm... Fair enough...
We need to look for clues. That's how we find them.
Hmmm...
Could this be... a Dreampoint?
Yes, look—this is where the Dream Stone rested.
This place is a Dreampoint!
A what?
A Dreampoint.
It's a place where dreamers can be one with their dreams.
There are multiple Dreampoints scattered throughout the island.
Sleeping on this Dreampoint may give us what we need...
The whereabouts of the Dream Stone!
So we sleep here and search the dream world for clues?
Indeed.
You heard the man, Luigi!
Rest your head upon me, and enter the world of dreams!
Please try not to drool...
Good luck, Mario!
So?! Spill it! What did you find out?
The Dream Stone is on Mount Pajamaja!
Mount Pajawhatsa? Where's that?
It's on the north side of the island. Behind Pi'illo Castle.
Behind Pi'illo Castle! Gotcha!
Let's hurry to Mount Pajamaja!
Britta is scouting a new job site, but...
It's not going well. She seems MAD.
Keep going to the right if you want to see her.
But think it over, seriously. Me, I'd steer way clear.
Great day, I am back to normal! Thank you so much!
Wait... I recall sleeping in the desert, but not underground...
Perhaps quicksand pulled me under while I was petrified...
This cave is cool! 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
I'm so glad the two of you found me here!
I was almost a pillow rock for all time!
Seriously, I owe you guys forever!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
All of the Pi'illo folk have been saved!
Thank you so much, Mario and Luigi!
Hurry to Mushrise Park and tell Eldream!
Don't delay! Adjust the height before time runs out.
Hang on!
This shiny rock...
Such a mysterious color! All glowy and pretty...
This is an extremely rare type of mineral called Dozing Ore.
Water penetrates the ore and distills within it...
It leaks back out as what we know as Dozing Drops!
Wow... Trickling down over such a long time span...
Turning into something new... Nature is so, SO awesome!
Dreambert, you know pretty much everything about this island, huh?
Hahahahaha!
I suppose that's correct! It is my home, and I know it well!
Allow me to illustrate with one more important detail!
When the Dozing Drops become solid...
They form into the Dozing Mattress! Which is what we're looking for!
WHAAAT?!
So that means... It's below this rock?!
Mario, Luigi! We must press onward!
The Dozing Mattress is somewhere below!
We're almost there! Let's hurry!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
So this is supposedly... the Dozing Mattress?
Doesn't look mattressy... No way this is it!
What? Seriously. Don't stare at me...
Where is it? You said the Dozing Mattress was here.
The only thing here is this old, weird-looking log chunk!
My... My knowledge is honest and true!
It must be somewhere around here!
Hm? Perhaps... A Dreampoint?
Hmm... Might be... In that case...
Something must be off in the dream world!
Correct. It must be so! We should delve in!
Mario! Luigi!
Find some clues in the dream!
Did you find the Dozing Mattress?
So the drops were petrified in the dream world! Of course!
Hey, I TOLD you that! From the beginning!
I said the Dozing Mattress was around here!
Oh, chill out. You're just mad we doubted you...
Nonsense! I am royalty! I am above pettiness!
Riiiiight.
In any case! We move on...
We must go and look for the other Zee Parts.
Remember, the menu has info on the other parts!
We now have all of the Zee Parts!
Now we must find the master bed maker in Wakeport.
Only he can assemble the five parts we collected!
Yes, the Bedsmith... Ah, I remember him now!
He was such a master, he was CALLED Bedsmith!
Who knows? He may well be trapped in a nightmare chunk.
Or he may be in the last place we'd expect him to be.
We must search high and low, of that I am sure.
So this road supposedly leads to the resort town...
I guess the road's not open yet? This one guy just got sent back.
According to the guidebook, that place is HAPPENING.
I can't wait to get there! I'll buy things like crazy!
The road beyond this point supposedly leads to the town...
But there are WAY too many strong monsters for my taste!
I'm serious, you may get roughed up if you go there!
Make sure you're strong enough before you try!
I heard that a big storm hit this island recently...
Yeah, that's what spawned all these monsters!
Gee, I wonder if that guy who headed to town is OK...
These ruined parapets lead to Pi'illoper, the Pi'illo collector.
No trespassing! Thank you kindly! -Pi'illoper
Do not delay after clearing a ring, The fall always comes after the spring.
Oh...
Doesn't look like anyone comes back here!
It's so different from the bustle of Wakeport.
The peace and quiet is a nice change of pace!
Huh? You see someone? Where?
So, I finally found the way to the hidden treasure.
But what's that thing wanderin' around?!
La-la la laaaaa!
Traveling is kinda neat!
But...
All these people around really wear Wiggler out.
Wiggler's missing the smell of Wiggler's garden!
There are a bunch of flowers around here!
And there aren't a ton of people around!
Wiggler's got it!
Wiggler will make a field of flowers right here!
That should help Wiggler relax!
OK, let's get to it!
That weird bug thing is patrollin' the area...
Smells like the fuzz.
That collector musta hired... A SECURITY GUARD!
Popple ain't gonna mess this one up, see?
Gotta be real cautious-like.
Scram! I'm busy!
It's either nab that loot or go home empty handed.
The Shadow Thief's reputation is on the line!
Got that? I said scram!
NYAH!
Don't go near that thing, ya palookas!
Oh, boy... These drips again.
What's with you mugs, anyways?!
You keep crashin' my parties...
Ah-HAAA!
Heh!
You guys...are thieves too, ain't ya?
The Shadow Thief knows a thief when he sees one!
Yeah, yeah. It all makes sense now.
I always run into your bearded mugs...
Every time I'm about to lift somethin'!
No wonder...you two showed up right now!
(I can use these drips to KO the security guard!)
(Then I'll steal the loot from under their big, fat noses!)
(That's the ball game, see? The Shadow Thief wins!)
HEAR ME OUT!
We're both after the same thing, yeah? Let's team up!
Before we can get to the loot inside that house...
We gotta knock off fuzzy-wuzzy there.
You know... The fuzz? Criminy! Buncha amateurs.
That buggy mug there is a security guard!
He was hired by that freak Pi'illo collector!
Hmm...
If Wiggler plants some red flowers around here...
Wiggler could plant veggies over there!
Yeah, he's got the joint locked down real tight.
You can't tell from his face, but he's a real bruiser!
OK, ya drips. Let's do this!
We're gonna ice this fuzzball right now, see?
Relax, will ya? We're just gonna talk!
OK! Let's try that again!
HEY!
AAAAH!
You can't just walk in here like that!
Wiggler's building a garden here!
Shutcha trap and beat it, punk!
WHAT?!
How dare you insult Wiggler in Wiggler's flower sanctuary!
Wiggler found this place first. Fair and square!
Nyah ha ha!
Bring it on, ya wannabe moth!
These two and I will cream ya!
Did you just say...
Moth?!
Wiggly Wiggler...
Is full of...
RAAAAAAGE!
But...
You drips look like a coupla wet noodles, see?
Score yourselves some more loot...
And gain more experience, will ya?
You drips need to find some more loot...
And gain more experience, see?
Until then, I'll be scopin' that guy from here!
I see that look on your ugly mugs...
You swiped somethin' real nice, didn't ya?
You musta gained enough experience too.
All right! You guys are my lackeys now.
Yeeowch...
That really hurt! Why are you so mean?
All Wiggler wanted was to make a flower garden.
The flowers are Wiggler's good friends...
You're tellin' me...
We fought...
Over a stupid...
F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f- f-f-f-fffffffffffffff...
FLOWER GARDEN?!
Don't insult Wiggler's flower friends!
You jerk!
WIGGLER MAKES YOU PAY!
YEEEEEEEOW!
That's it! I'm done with this stupid island!
Sigh... Why'd we get involved in this mess?
Well, at least Popple is gone now.
And the island is better off for it!
Speaking of better off...
The house that he was trying to break into...
That's that Pi'illo-collector guy's house, right?
Maybe we can find a clue about Bedsmith.
Wahaaa! I'm back to normal again!
The sun feels so nice and warm!
My head feels fluffy with purest joy!
I can't thank you enough for saving me!
Hello there! 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
I'm glad to know Prince Dreambert is safe.
If you folks didn't save us, no one would have...
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
All of the Pi'illo folk have now been freed.
My deepest thanks, Mario and Luigi!
We should go to Mushrise Park and tell Eldream.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm back to normal!
I feel so light! So free!
I had given up hope.
I beg of you: help the other Pi'illos, too!
I won't forget this! Thank you, heroes!
Hi! Hello! 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
It's hard to believe there's a town beyond the wall...
But it must be true since I can hear people's voices!
I should go there and play! Play until I drop!
My Pi'illo pals!
Welcome! Please make yourselves at home!
Bask in Pi'illoper's secret collection!
Showing my collection to fellow Pi'illo enthusiasts...
This is what I live for! Squeeeeeeeeep!
Umm...
We've seen dozens of these in Pi'illo Castle.
I guess you don't have what we're looking for.
Impossible!
NOT IMPRESSED?!
NOOOOOOOOOO!
This is the worst day of my entire liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiife!
NO! Wait! You haven't even seen my most prized item!
You're gonna flip when you see this!
SUPER-RARE PILLOW!
HA! Impressed yet? Yeah, thought so.
The pattern on this pillow is one of a kind.
THAT'S IT!
GAH!
This pattern... I am certain!
This is the bed master, Bedsmith!
AAAAAAH!
Then that means...
If we fix this pillow...
We can get him to make the Ultibed?!
P-P-PI'ILLO?!
Oh golly molly! He's alive? He's MOVING?!
How is this even possible?!
Greetings. You appear to be going into shock...
But would it be OK if we kept this pillow?
Y-yes, noble Pi'illo! You may keep it!
You can even keep ME if you want!
That...won't be necessary.
Mario!
Luigi!
Shall we save Bedsmith?
WHOOOOOOA!
He just went inside of that!
Is this really happening?!
You're gonna be fine, kid. Just take a deep breath!
I never thought I would meet a Pi'illo in real life!
This is the greatest day of my liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiife!
Enter the dream world? 
No    
Yes
GRRR!
Antasma! Show yourself, you miserable villain!
My chisel of justice and hammer of anger await!
Wait... Hm? 
Where am I? What have I been doing all this time?!
BEDSMITH!
Oh! If it isn't the soft, fluffy, oh-so-nappable Prince Dreambert!
The presence of such royalty... It truly makes one want to...
...Nap on you!
Um... Dreambert. Did he say...nap on you?
Ah... He has ever been thus... He has...some strange notions...
But he's the best of the Bedsmiths! That's why he is called Bedsmith!
Oh, OK. If you say so...
Hear me, Bedsmith! During that battle...
We were all petrified by nightmare chunks!
My companions are helping us revive the other Pi'illos.
Ah, is this so?
I knew not that we Pi'illos were enduring such suffering!
BEDSMITH! IS! SHOCKED!
And that's not all...
Antasma has returned to this island as well.
He's joined up with Bowser! They want to conquer the world!
We need your assistance in order to stop them!
Ah... The steely visage of a prince in his hour of need... It makes one want to...
NAP! ON! YOU!
But I...
I am but a simple bed maker. I create beauty, not destruction...
That is just it!
I understand.
You mean me to destroy Antasma with raw artistic beauty.
What? No. Seriously? You're a bed maker...
We need you to make the Ultibed for us!
THE ULTIBED?!
I cannot do this! We would need...
We already have all five Zee Parts!
Right, guys?
I see... This does make our path easier!
Let us make the Ultibed immediately!
Wait, where are you going?
To Somnom Woods! For there is my shop.
I will abide there, so bring the Zee Parts.
It has been long...
BEDSMITH! IS! PUMPED!
We should go as well!
I have no idea what's going on...
But as a Pi'illo enthusiast... Being a part of this was...
RAD! Huff... Whuff...
Is this...the mountain's treasure?
That shape! It must be the Pajamaja Rock Frame!
OOOOOH!
I-i-is treasure?!
Is legendary frame! Frame actually exists!
Hey, thanks for guiding us all the way up here!
No need for thanking!
Is pinnacle of tour-guide life! We regret nothing now!
Wow! That attitude... You guys are solid!
Massif Bros. check out area for a good while.
Treasure is yours! Go forth and beef!
Uh...thanks!
Well then, I guess we can get going!
WAIT!
Dreambert! What's up?
This is indeed one of the Zee Parts we seek.
There is no doubt it is the Pajamaja Rock Frame!
However, clear your mind and truly SEE it!
It's petrified by a nightmare chunk!
Now that you mention it... It DOES look ominous.
In that state, we shouldn't use it to make the Ultibed.
Well, there's only one real way to cleanse it... Sleep on it.
Ah, I get you. We go into the dream world and break the chunk?
Correct. It appears to be our only choice.
Mario. Luigi. Do your best!
Such a mystical place on mountain! Is earth flexing beauty muscle.
Tree and rock types totally new! Is like magic...
We are big tour guides, da, so we will stay for research.
Cutlets go on with adventure! Do not worry for Massif Bros.!
We are tour guides for long time, but rock like this is totally new!
Is research time! Then we give speech on rock for next tour!
Massif Bros. have never been to this part of mountain!
We must stay, so cutlets must harness inner beef and go on!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
You got the Pajamaja Rock Frame!
I can't believe that could happen to one of the parts...
How could it get hit by a nightmare chunk?
The chunks flew everywhere when Antasma broke the stone.
One must have flown here and landed directly on it.
Well, thank heavens we got it back to normal!
Yes, this is fortunate. It is now safe to use!
Very well! We must seek the next part of the bed!
Yup! Let's keep this good feeling going! Let's hunt!
Remember, the menu has info about the other parts!
It is time. We now hold all the parts we need!
Now we must find the master bed maker in Wakeport.
Only he can assemble the five parts we collected!
Yes, the Bedsmith... Ah, I remember him now!
He was such a master, he was CALLED Bedsmith!
Who knows? He may well be trapped in a nightmare chunk.
Or he may be in the last place we'd expect him to be.
We must search high and low, of that I am sure.
You come!
Is steep, da? Is precipice!
Mountain shows true beef now!
We go beef for beef to survive!
Is time to muscle up! Is new skill time!
Da, new technique made over 25 years!
Ready, large bro?!
Bring beef!
MASSIF ABS!
Super-beef-muscle-flex-ultra- special-double-ab-crunch-jump!
AKA
BALL HOP!
Uh uh uh... Is nice, da?
Is perfect bro synchronization with ultimate ab flexing...
Is possible to bounce off ground like toy ball of baby!
Da! Now, cutlets!
Press R Button three times to change action icon to Ball Hop!
Both A and B Buttons are same icon, da?
Is nice! Cutlets can start with either button!
Red guy starts first for this time!
Press A Button and Ball Hop starts!
Use Circle Pad on landing to move!
IS GOOD!
Now cutlets get up here in ball shape!
Is perfect!
Press A Button for normal!
Special move makes muscles chortle at mountain cliffs!
Master Ball Hop and mountain cries for mercy!
Da! We go on! We wait ahead!
Use Ball Hop to catch up!
Is super!
You learned the Bros. Move Ball Hop!
Now you can get to places too high to reach with a normal jump!
CRAZY CUTLETS! Is wrong way!
Learning move is half! Practice is other half!
Start Ball Hop and come here now!
It takes Massif Bros. 25 years to come up with move...
And cutlets master it in just seconds! Is madness!
But abs must be iron to climb whole way!
Da! We move! Tour just begins!
Well, hello there! And welcome!
This is the dream world's tour center!
Wonderful journeys await you. In fact...
We have the perfect seasonal tour right now!
The Mushroom Deep Dive!
Introducing...
We can arrange ANY type of tour... Adaptability—that's our signature!
JUST ASK!
Let's explore what's on your mind!
Your ask is to hear about other tours?
So, a tour related to Big Massif, huh?
Looking for Big Massif in the dream world, are we?
Want to wake up Big Massif, do we?
NO TOUR FOR THAT!
He says he wants you to spar with him!
Win what he calls the Beef-Off, and Big Massif will meet you!
Hello? Tour center, what's on your ask list?
That was Big Massif on the line!
Hm?
Yes?
Big Massif...
Battle...
Mustache guys...
Beef-Off?
I see... OK, I'll ping you back in a sec.
Well then, let me know when you've decided.
Then I'll just call Big Massif back.
Do you two accept Big Massif's challenge? 
No          
Yes
Come back when you're ready.
OK then, I'll just give Big Massif a buzz.
Hello? Big Massif? Tour center here.
The two gentlemen agreed to the Beef-Off.
Hm?
Your disciples? A "beef" assessment?
Doesn't look like much beef to assess...
Heavy Zest in the house!
Sorrow Fist!
Thunder Sass!
Beef Cloud!
BEEF CLOUD!
Wake up, Beef Cloud!
Aw yeah!
I'd really appreciate it if I could just sit here a bit...
Sniff... I dropped a piece of candy, and I am just super bummed...
HOO-RAW!
Out the way! MOOOOVE!
Mwaaah... Mornin'.
We are the Hooraws! Disciples of Big Massif!
We have these Hooraw Medals... You've gotta fight us for them...
That's the only way to prove you're dude enough to spar with Big Massif.
So if we defeat you four, we can meet Big Massif?
Aw yeah... 
But a fight with no big buildup is super boring...
So we're gonna hide to pump this action up!
You wanna fight us, you gotta find us!
Hooraws out!
They are fleet...
Very well! Mario! Dreamy Luigi!
We must track these Hooraws and meet them in battle!
You have to defeat all four of them and collect their Hooraw Medals!
Then and ONLY then can you meet Big Massif!
Welcome back!
You defeated all the Hooraws!
Hello, tour center here!
Two challengers have bested the Hooraws!
Ah! Big Massif has just arrived!
And so, without further ado... Heeere's Big Massif!
BIG MASSIF!
What is this?
So where is Big Massif?
Bffffff... Snnnrk!
What... Explain this insolent laughter!
YOU! You were Big Massif all along!
UH! UH! UH!
Uh uh uh uh huh! Is...too funny!
Whole time is big disguise! Is perfect fake accent!
Da! Is me! Is Big Massif!
We have no time for games! You must wake immediately!
We must climb Mount Pajamaja with all haste!
NYET!
In dream world, I battle challengers of true beef...
Is best way to pump up muscles and mind!
Real world is weak! Big Massif stay here!
Then so it must be! We will take your challenge!
But be warned: we have come far and bested many trials!
Uh uh uh uh! Is plan all along!
You are little cutlets, but still beefiest challengers yet!
Hooraws! Come!
We show daily muscle routine!
HYAH!
HUURGH!
Is beef, da?! Muscle smash!
Real muscle laughs at rocks!
Sweet smash, Master!
Master's so burly, he even laughs at THIS rock...
He'll totally turn it to powder!
Right? Or is it too big, you think?
Is... Is... Is... Is cake!
Uh... Do it!
Nice one, Master!
Master's totally gonna launch up and super surprise 'em!
Dude just KNOWS how to put on a show!
Da... Was cake!
Is good for muscle, flexing in dirt, da?
Is rare technique!
Da... Whole routine is planned, even last part!
So now we go... Cutlets are ready?
I hope you get it now.
The real world boasts many champions as well!
LET'S BEEF!
Is full-contact battle! Is tenderizing time!
Pafff... Heefff... I... I...am loser?
They thrashed the master... Who ARE these dudes?!
Let's bolt!
Is crazy... Little cutlets hide huge muscles...
Uhh... Is crushing...
I go to real world! I rethink training!
Beefstaches!
One day, we have rematch, da?
I leave!
Dream world!
Hmm...
I sense these events will make Big Massif wake.
We should return to the real world.
They're here! BAIL, DUDES!
Hello and welcome! Take a load off!
How may I serve you? 
Items 
Gear 
Pi'i-latte          
Never mind
That's 10 coins, please! 
No         
Yes
You don't have enough coins.
Hey, you guys! This way, please!
    HP and BP fully restored!    
I sense this is a new Luiginary Work.
Please reach out to me if you need guidance.
Try touching Luigi on the Touch Screen.
If Mario could move faster...
That would make it easier to get around.
If the left side of the stache makes you slow...
I wonder what happens when you touch the right side?
Touching the right side of the stache makes Mario faster...
And touching the left side makes him move slower.
Start by having Dreamy Luigi enter the Luiginary Work.
Press the R Button to switch the action icon, then press the B Button.
Wow!
I see! Pulling the right side of the stache makes Mario faster!
I see! Pulling the left side of the stache makes Mario slower!
This Luiginary Work alters Mario's movement speed.
Touching Luigi's nose seems to reset the speed.
Let's use this power to get through this area!
What's wrong? Did you get stuck?
Do you need help? 
No          
Yes
Positively.
If only Mario had a way to make his jump more floaty...
Now that I think about it...
Didn't you move more slowly earlier?
Isn't there a way to make Mario move more slowly?
What was it? The right side makes him move faster...
But the left side of the stache...
Yes! If Mario moves slowly...
His jump becomes more floaty, and he can jump higher.
First, we need to put Dreamy Luigi in the Luiginary Work.
Press the R Button to switch the action icon, then press the B Button.
Steady...
Danger!
NO BUMP!
Big Massif?
Nyet. Nyet. Is Li'l Massif.
What is Massif exercise? Little cold cuts cannot tell?
Is high-altitude training for heart.
Da, sometimes true muscle must climb to high places...
Is where courage lives! Is beef test from daily life!
But da, now... I change mind.
Is no way. Nyet.
Is too scary. Big scary.
If landing could be floaty and easy, da, well...
Is easy beef stew then! Da! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!
WAIT UP!
Haarff... Whafff...
Big Massif sent me...

...So says Big Massif.
Now it begins! Battle 
 of...
THE BEEF-OFF!
Your opponent is Sorrow Fist!
In this round...
THAT is the extra spice added to the battle!
Win with Excellent hits only!
You know how Excellent appears when you stomp a foe just right?
Well, all damage you deal must be from Excellent strikes!
All non-Excellent damage is forfeit and will heal your foe!

Congrats are due! You bested all four!
Please return to the dreamy tour center.
Big Massif will meet you there.
I'm gonna lose anyway... I'm a super weakling...
Snurffle... Wahh... I just wanna go home...
Huh? Even somebody like me can get huge?
I can rise to a challenge just like the other guys?
If I put my mind to it, I can totally whale on you guys?
It's pointless... I'll just lose...
I stink at stuff...
Bwaaaah...
Believe in myself! ...You say?
Yes, I am called Sorrow Fist.
You want to spar with me? I'm not really that buff...
If I defeat you guys, I'll totally get buffer!
Thanks...
My mind was totally blank while I was fighting... Felt good.
VICTORS! MARIO BROS.!
Well, here we go... Go, go, go, gooo!
For better or worse, this is the last one! 
Well, hello again!
You got a Hooraw Medal!
One! Two!
Ah, is good! Shrimp cocktails come here to beef up too?
Big Massif?
Nyet. Is Li'l. Li'l Massif.
What is Massif exercise? Is not obvious?
Is ab work! Is crunching! Abs will bounce like iron!
Da, using abs to bounce back things that plummet from sky...
Is beef test from daily life! Is common thing, da?
You see switch over there?
You hit that...
Boomski! A bomb is falling from above!
Da! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!
Li'l Massif is always pushing beef limit!
Is pumping up, da? Is feeling burn, da?
But...is too scary. I do not try yet.
I was only muscle enough to pile up blocks over there...
Abs will bounce bombs to hit blocks, and...
BEEF! CRACKING! BOOM! That is plan.
Would be epic beef. Is good training, da?
Da... But enough talk. Is more crunch time.
Abs must be iron beef to bounce back bombs...
Must tilt upper body down, then launch back up quick...
Is technical move, da...
Lift...QUICK!
Hrrgh!
Da! Is good!
Is nice!
HANG ON!
Heeff... Hoooff...
Big Massif sent me...
I will preside over this battle!

Oh! The nightmare chunk is right before our eyes!
Hmm... But how to get this nightmare chunk out...
Oh well, we have no other choice.
We must find a way to reach the nightmare chunk!
Hya hyuh hyuh... Myuh hyuh huh...
Golly molly, just think... Hyuh... A Pi'illo's inside there...
Hyah!
So super exciting, golly, I'm even talking to myself.
Hya hyuh huh... Brings a BIG smile to my face...
HYAAAAH!
Oh!
Gee!
Wah!
Guh!
Good golly molly, that scared me!
Hyuh.
I trust you mustachioed gentlemen came to observe the nightmare chunk?
I myself come here every day! Is this your first time, gentlemen?
Well then, allow me a word or two! That's a nightmare chunk, you see...
Very well!
As an aficionado of all things Pi'illo, I shall take this upon myself...
It is now my duty, sirs, to inform you about this nightmare chunk!
Within it, a member of the Pi'illo folk lies in slumber.
And keep it quiet...
The Pi'illo within this particular nightmare chunk...
Well, rumors abound that it is a Pi'illo unlike any other!
In other words... Exceedingly... Exceptionally... Extremely rare!
At least, that's the scuttlebutt among us dedicated enthusiasts.
Any questions thus far?
How could one retrieve that nightmare chunk, you ask?
Hyuh, a bold question from an uninitiated!
Welllllll...
Hitting those blocks is SUPPOSED to release the nightmare chunk.
But it also supposedly unleashes a terrible, gigantic guardian...
Lore tells us that many have tried to touch the chunk...
But the guardian's wrath was severe and horrible...
Now none remain with the courage to attempt it.
Frankly, an enthusiast of my caliber is content just observing it...
In any case...
I must retire to brainstorm my next Pi'illo Monthly article...
I will take my leave.
GOLLY MOLLY!
Gentlemen! Doom!
DOOOOOM!
The guardian approaches!
The guardian I informed you of... He comes, and he is wroth!
Well then, sirs. I now exit...
Best of luck!

Did you think I would let you pass so easily?
No, the way forward is bought with suffering...
Yes, you must suffer my ruthless challenge...
The airborne terror... The Test of Jumping!
Can you possibly survive this horrific aerial trial?
Do you dare learn about the Test of Jumping? 
No          
Yes
Are you suuuure?
Can I convince you to listen to the Test of Jumping? 
No          
Yes
I hope you mourn your decision for eternity...
Jumping uses the...
A and B Buttons!
You, dressed in red, use the A Button...
And you, in green, use the B Button...
It sounds easy, though you two will certainly fail to grasp it...
And... In failure, your jumps will fall ever short...
And you will never get up there!
No, it will be impossible for you...
Only use of the A and B Buttons can navigate this uneven ground...
You would need to use the Circle Pad to move...
And press the A and B Buttons in sequence...
Small praise is due for your progress...
But the next test will mean your end!
Your next test is...
Small praise is due for your progress...
But the next test will mean your end!
Ah, but will you survive the next test? Likely not.
Would you hear about the next test anyway? 
No          
Yes
Next...
Observe these yawning chasms...
To cross, press the A and B Buttons at the same time...
Yes, all while moving with the Circle Pad...
The A and B Buttons at the same time! Ha!
Your failure is certain...
Can you reach the leftmost point?
... ... ...
Don't expect things to remain easy...
For only now does the true test begin!
Yes, you heard me!
Are you sure? Noooo...
You DO want to hear it! 
No          
Yes
Your tests are not done...
Both red and green suffer... Brains ache with effort...
In the depths of despair, here you will surrender...
Urgh...
Again I fail. And right after the pink one defeated me...
This test clearly stinks.
But the next one will be your undoing!
I will not let you near the revered one...
Study the elevation pattern. Time your launch accordingly.
Mario and friends were invited to vacation on Pi'illo Island. But when they arrived, Princess Peach was kidnapped and taken into a dream world! Mario and Luigi went looking for her, but they've fallen into the depths of Pi'illo Castle!
Escape from the depths of Pi'illo Castle!
Hmm...
This pillow looks like Dreambert's...
Maybe another portal to the dream world will open if someone sleeps on it...
Huh...
No dice.
Mario, maybe you can't trigger it!
Wow! Looks like it has to be Luigi doing the sleeping!
A portal opens whenever he sleeps on these pillows.
He looks so comfy...
Maybe the fact that he conks out so easily helps open the way...
Correct.
Dreambert!
The wavelength of this one's sleep is extremely close to the Pi'illos'.
For this reason, when he sleeps on one of the Pi'illo folk...
He becomes one with the dream world and creates a portal...
This pillow is a Pi'illo?
Correct.
My people, the Pi'illos, were trapped within chunks of nightmare...
Their souls held hostage, they were dispersed across the island...
We must save them all immediately!
How can we help them?
The answer is already within you... for it is the way Mario saved me.
You must enter the dream world and destroy the nightmare chunks.
Now! Mario!
I ask this of you... Come with me! Come with me to the dream world!
Give me the aid I need to free my Pi'illo brethren from their prisons!
Hey, hold on!
We need to find Peach first!
She was taken into the dream world... She's our priority!
We can't spare the time to save the Pi'illos right now!
Ah, but if we free the Pi'illo folk...
One might know where Peach is.
True, but...
Not to be rude, but can't you save them on your own?
Would that this were true. For I attempted to...
But I failed to shatter the nightmare chunks...
I need Mario...
Without his power, I lack the strength to break the nightmarish bonds...
This, friends, is why I came here to find him!
Hm. Help you, huh?
OK.
I guess we have no other choice. It's our best chance to find Peach...
My thanks, Mario!
I shall come with you!
Guess I'll stay here and take care of Luigi!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
Oh joy! I am free!
Interesting...
If we break the nightmare chunks, the Pi'illos go back to normal, huh?
Correct.
Mario can shatter the chunks... and that is why I need him.
Mario...
My thanks for saving one of my people...
Many of them remain imprisoned, and I wish to save all that I can.
I would very much appreciate your help in this trial!
Just so you know, I will track the number of saved Pi'illos...
You can check your progress in the Collection on the menu!
By the way...
Have your eyes fallen upon a princess named Peach within the dream world?
These people seek her...
Princess Peach...
I am sorry, but no. I have seen nothing.
Alas...
Oh... Perhaps the elder?
Eldream, the Pi'illo elder... He might be of help...
Eldream the elder?
Yes. His mind holds all that is known of the dream world...
Doubtless he will bring some enlightenment to you.
I sense Eldream is somewhere to the south of here.
South of here is...
Mushrise Park!
Mario!
Let us away to this place called Mushrise Park!
Uh, first we need to get out of here...
Ah! Of course...
Click!
Follow this path to ascend from the underground!
Thank you!
What is it? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
The path I opened will lead you back aboveground.
It seems we cannot proceed unless we revive this Pi'illo...
Mario, we must return to the dream world!
I'll take Luigi duty!
Ahhhh! I live!
Oh, my liberator! Mustached and red!
I must thank you! I owe you one!
Hey!
Did you see a princess in the dream world?
What's this? A princess?
Hmm...
No memory of that...
Crud.
Say...
Your dress is foreign to me...
A pair, red and green, clad in matching jumpsuits...
Another, yellow, in the nude...
HEY NOW! Who's nude?!
Open your eyes!
I have SHOES!
Back me up here, you guys!
Just shoes?
Anyway...
Tell me...
How were you Pi'illos trapped in those chunks anyway?
Huh? Really? You do not know?
Please allow me to enlighten you...
We Pi'illos inhabited this island long ago.
Our people were blessed with the ability to travel in and out of the dream world...
I had no idea...
That is why I ask...
We must help as many of my Pi'illos as we can.
The Pi'illo Kingdom can rise again if we are brave and true.
And as we go about this great work, we may well find your princess...
What?
You suspect the one who kidnapped Princess Peach in the dream world...
You think it could be Antasma? This is what your heart tells you?
What happened to Antasma after he was trapped in the dream world?
I have clarity up to the moment Antasma was brought to bay and trapped...
But events after that are beyond the reach of my mind's eye...
But I do not think... No, it cannot be...
Well...
We're not getting anywhere by just navel gazing here!
Our new priority has to be to get info from the Pi'illos!
Let's get to it!
If you wish to go above here, please speak with me!
I shall help you anytime you call!
Do you need my help? 
I need help 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Use the Circle Pad to change your destination.
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
Phew...
At last!
Thank you!
Excuse me!
Do you have any info on where Princess Peach might be in the dream world?
Princess Peach...
You're saying someone took her down some sort of hole... Correct?
That's ALL we know...
Where they took her underground is a total mystery...
Perhaps...
She might have been taken to Dream's Deep...
Dream's Deep? This place exists?
Highness!
Yes, it exists.
Based on what we know, I sense a strong possibility she is in Dream's Deep.
Hmmmmm... Dream's Deep...
Dream's Deep is deep, the nadir of the dream...
I feel as though I have been there before...
HAVE I been there? Or have I not?
Hm...
My mind is cloudy...
Oh no...
Oh, of course!
Head south from here, and you shall find the elder of the Pi'illos, Eldream.
Eldream might know how to enter Dream's Deep.
You speak true... Eldream must know of it.
When we reach the ground level, we must head south...
Let us go to this place called Mushrise Park.
Thank you!
We're closer to the princess, I know it!
Ah! Talk to me if you want to go quickly to the ground level.
Can I help you? 
I need help 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Watch out!
If you lose your balance and are about to topple...
Use the Circle Pad to find your center.
I'll be watching to make sure you're OK.
Please take care.
The ground is uneven in places, so watch your step.
But don't worry too much if the Luiginoids collapse.
Dreamy Luigi can just enter the Luiginary Work again.
You seem to have found harmony.
Let us press on.
It seems you are too tall to move forward.
Try getting rid of all the Luiginoids.
First, press the R Button.
All the Luiginoids will pile up.
Now, press the B Button.
Good.
Luiginary powers will be useful in many situations.
If you get stuck, try going into a Luiginary state.
Hmm... Dreamy Luigi is reacting to something.
That constellation... A Luiginary Work?
What might it do?
The anticipation!
So you just...went out and came back?
What? WOW!
Can this be? All of the stars!
They're turning into Luiginoids!
I've heard of this before! Yes, but only in legend!
This Luiginary Work creates multiple copies of the dreamer!
Now that's what I call...
LUIGINARY!
Nothing can stop us now!
Let's continue!
Hmm... I wonder if he can jump?
Yes! Let's go!

No          
Yes
What's going on? 
Talk to me

Never mind
Where...am I?
What is this huge building?
Why am I standing here?!
Who would build such an ugly castle?!
Do you guys know who built this castle?
Is there an ugly-castle convention in town?
All the Pi'illo Folk have been saved!
We are in your debt, Mario and Luigi!
Let's go to Mushrise Park and inform Eldream!
Welcome to our new, uh... mysterious-castle location!
We figure anyone in this area is really desperate.
And desperate customers equal MEGA PROFITS!
So don't despair! Let your wallet do the crying!
How can I help you?

We're finally here...
It seems unguarded for the most part...
Come, let's make haste! Be at one with wariness!
Ahh, this feels great!
Well, the castle fell...
Lord Bowser sure didn't seem too fazed about it.
Whatever...
Lounging by this vine RULES! It just drains the fatigue away.
The vines are sorta creepy... I mean, they're great, but...
Agreed. They are suspicious. A guy has to wonder...
What kind of energy is flowing through them? It looks...off.
Come on, man. We're just need-to-know grunts, and we don't need to know that.
Haah... Yeah. Grunts. I miss being the elite team, know what I mean?
Good times...
Ma-Mario!
The castle has been infiltrated!
Crud!
Listen, we may be floor scrubbers now, but we'll scrub it with you!
All right, men! It's time! Operation Special Move!
UNLEASH!
LETHAL!
RETREAT!
I know they're the bad guys, but I can't help but be impressed with their foot speed...
Now that we're within the walls, I trust there will be many guards...
Mario! Luigi! Breathe deep! Find your inner focus!
Minions! You must jump REALLY high to activate the gate switch.
But DO NOT LEAVE IT OPEN. Or Lord Bowser will be UPSET.

Ooh, a WARM welcome to Neo Bowser Castle!
Ka ha ha ha! So you came all the way here just to be destroyed?!
I'll admit, knocking the castle from the sky was impressive...but that was just luck.
And from now on, I think you'll find that things have turned most awfully bad!
Kee hee hee!
The paths between rooms... Oh, they're all messed up!
You may wander in this room for the rest of your sad lives!
SCREEPTH!
Kamek... This vay...
Keh!
I am your only key to moving on... and you'll never catch me!
And as you suffer, I trust you'll regret ever making Bowser mad!
Kamek fled into the dream world...
We have to try to get to that spot somehow!
If Luigi can sleep there, we can chase Kamek!
First, though, we need to do something about this cage!
I'm sure there's a switch somewhere through there...
Finally! We can head to the dream world.
Kamek's in there somewhere! Let's go after him!
The passages between rooms seem to be back to normal.
All right! Let's go!

Well, time to lose you for good, then!
Oh, whoops! Messed with all the passages in the other rooms!
Sorry, there's no escape for you now! You'll be stuck here FOREVERRRR!
Ugh, he ran off to the dream world again...
And again, a cage is in our way...
We'll never trigger that switch ourselves...
But maybe we can drop something from above...
I wonder if there's something beyond those tracks...

KYAAAAAAAH! You IDIOTS!
Great. Just great. You borked my magic!
I didn't get to twist the doors as much as I would've liked...
But no matter. It's still complex enough to trap your small brains.
This is the end for you! Wander here FOREVER!
Finally, we can move forward properly now.
Correct. But do not let your guards down.
Mario! Luigi! Be mindful!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
Halt!
Beyond that door...
I feel the presence of Antasma!
Mario! Luigi! Let's finish this!
This flame...
It appears to erupt from the dream world...
Doubtless we can only douse it by traveling to that world...
There must be a Dreampoint somewhere near the flame!
Let's find it to stop the fire!
Yes!
Snuff the other two as well! Onward!
One more to go! Almost finished!
Now we can move on! Come, we must go!
What... is that?
Bogey on approach... Is that...a bird?
Negative... Appears to be an airborne dumpling.
What? Seems more like a chubby sky pig to me.
That's a negative, Private. Ugly air frog confirmed!
AYEEEE!
TROUBLE!
EVAC!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
Hmpf!
Mario and his buddies... All up in my castle.
Guy is probably patting himself on the back for knocking my pad down! What a JERK.
SCREEET!
This castle vill not be so easy to navigate...
They vill fall long before they reach us... SCREEK!
Whatever. Forget about them! Let's conquer the world already!
SCREEP! Very vell...
First, vee must fill some energy... SCREEKLE!
Right, right. Dream energy, gotcha. Wanna conk out some minions?
This time, Bowser... I vant YOU to sleep...
ME?!
Your ambition... Your power lust... This is bottomless und pure...
The energy from your dreams vill be raw und powerful...
Yeah... You've got a point. I am pretty incredible.
Let's do it! I'll throw a massive sleep down right now!
And when I wake up, Mario will be gone and I'll conquer the world! YEAH!
GWAHAHAHA!
There! It's Bowser!
Unbelievable. He's sleeping.
Well, sweet! Let's KO him while he's KO'd!
No! Do not approach him! Look! Beneath his head...
That foul pillow... Is that...Antasma?!
Yes... And...
He's likely absorbing the power of Bowser's dream as he sleeps...
Oh no! He's converting Bowser's dreams into energy!
Yes, and the castle pulses with life due to that energy.
These vine-like things are distributing it throughout.
Yes...
These vines originate with Antasma.
If Bowser wakes up, the energy flow will soon cease, but...
But what? Let's detach Bowser from Antasma right now!
Focus. As you saw when Luigi tried earlier...
That barrier will spurn any direct assault.
What's that?! You're saying you'll go into Bowser's dream world?!
What'll you do once you get in there?
Oh... You hadn't thought that far ahead, huh...
Of course!
We could attempt the same thing we did to awaken Big Massif!
I shall attach myself to these vines...
It will merge Luigi's dream with Bowser's...
And with luck, we can wake Bowser from the dream world!
Ah, right! I get it! That might work!
Very well. These connect directly to Antasma...
If I bind myself to this...
Luigi!
I hope their dreams merged as expected...
Mario! Look!
Mario! Green stache!
How dare you invade my dreams?! That's private Bowser time!
SCREENK! Always, these pests vex us...
Hmph! "Vex"? Whatever.
Time to finish these twerps!
Mario! Green stache!
I'll be upstairs! Don't chicken out!
SCREENKY!
This is the end for you, Dreambert... SCREETCH!
I vill never give you the Dream Stone... SCREE!
Foul Antasma...
Look! The energy that flowed through the vines...
It flows no more because Bowser awoke.
All right!
There must be a dead end up here somewhere!
Let's corner them both and finish this thing!
Mario, Luigi! We near the end.
Be at one with final preparations!
SCREEP! Impressive, to haff come so far...
Antasma! Hear me! This is the end for you!
This time, I will ensure you never return!
SCREEK!
I haff heard those vords before, a long time ago...
But this time vill be different... I haff Bowser on my si—
Vut?! Ouch!
Hmph!
I don't work well with others!
SCREEK! Vut do you mean by this?!
I mean you're an idiot!
You thought you were using me? ME?!
Buddy, I was playing you like a bat fiddle!
Vut in the... No! How could you?!
I'll tell you how. This castle? Peach? The Dream Stone?
ALL MINE. You hear me? They belong to Bowser!
Lord Bowser! Everything's set!
MARIO! LUIGI!
Why don't you guys have yourselves a pity party? Me, I'm done with you.
Dream Stone! Let's get dreamy!
Take me to the top!
Such a betrayal... I pity you, Antasma!
SCREEP! Save your pity. Save it for Bowser!
But before I take him... Dreambert... I vill...
TAKE YOU!
So it comes to this, Antasma! I accept!
Let us settle this once and for all!
Is that all?! Come on!
SCREEYEE!
I can open dream portals venever I vish now...
For that is vut I vished from the Dream Stone...
In the dream vorld, I vill be at full strength...
I haff changed, Dreambert. You haff been varned...
No! Stop!
Dreambert!
Dreambert! Hold on!
Argh... He has... grown stronger...
Mario... Luigi...
I beg of you... Please save... the island...and the Dream Stone...
Oh, come ON! Seriously! They already caught up!
No good! We can expect no mercy!
Corporal Paraplonk! Sergeant Guy!
We will defend this castle, men! Rise up! THIS IS OUR TIME!
YEAH!
Whoa!
We have contact! They got through!
OK then...
GET ELITE!
EVERY DANG TIME!
That's it for me.
Well, I guess that's par for the course...
Mario! Luigi!
GWAHAHA!
It's about to end for you, chumps!
What? Look, just drop the tough-guy act, already!
Without that Dream Stone, you're a little NOTHING!
Hmph!
Hey, I'm just using available resources! That's called STRATEGY! Look it up!
Nonetheless, we cannot allow you to use the Dream Stone any longer!
And so we must cast you down, as we did to Antasma before you!
Antasma? That flappy bat? Don't compare me to him!
Now, Mario! And green stache! It's time to say good night!
I'm gonna use the Dream Stone to POOF! Make you disappear!
Dream Stone! Disappear 'em!
GROWCH!
How do you like THAT action?! Feel the power of good thoughts!
Consider your rampaging days over, Bowser!
Princess Peach! Starlow!
You must destroy him and the Dream Stone!
But... But... The stone...
Do it!
It's better that it be destroyed here than be used for Bowser's foul plans!
Um... If you say so... Peach, ready?
OK! I'm sorry, Dreambert!
What? NOOOOO! The Dream Stone!
NOT YET!
Ooogh! Pbbbth!
Bleargh! Gross!
The...Dream Stone... He inhaled its fragments!
That ain't good! My gut feels...
Whoa... Hang on... The ol' bod is...

This symbol...

I bet we must bring them together...
Yo, dudes! This way!
The dream world has expanded!
Yeah, buds! Unh! You made it!
You bring that second Dream Egg?
And did you scoop up all the sweet loot I scattered around?
Whoa, hold up. You saying I scattered loot AND monsters?!
Nah, dude. This place was JUST created. There shouldn't be any monsters!
Look, if there ARE monsters in here, some evil...something must have lured them!
Yeah, that ain't good. It means something bad got in. We need to hide Peach deeper.
All right, man! You know what's next! Get that Dream Egg ready! 
Oh, gotcha. You didn't snag it yet... You gotta hit my siblings up!
You want me to warp you back to the dream-world entrance? 
No  
Yes
Don't come back without it!
Aw yeah! That's the stuff!
The dream world is gonna fwoosh out even more with that bad boy!
Nice. Now we can go deeper. It'll be safer back in there!
I'll scoot ahead and leave some more stuff for you!
Make sure you snag it all! Remember. Earn it. EARN it.
Hey, and remember to bring that last Dream Egg, too, OK?
Mario!
You expanded the dream world for me again!
That is so sweet of you. I'll just wait for you here...
I'm sure there are dangers ahead, so be careful.

Oh baby! That's it!
With that thing, we are gonna max this place out!
Through there oughta be the deepest end of this dream world!
Trust me, ain't NOBODY gonna find Peach back in there!
Well, I think I'm done here. And with that...I'M OUT!
Say, now that I think on it... Y'know all those monsters?
You guys have any idea who could be luring them in here?
Bowser and his minions are looking for the princess, huh?
Gotcha, gotcha. Sounds rough. I'll keep my eyes peeled!
Mario...
Did Seadric just say that some villain is letting monsters into this dream world?
Well, I haven't seen anyone, but... I have to say, it's a bit worrying...
Oh, but I don't want you to worry. I'm fine. You can go check out the path ahead.
Just please, promise me you'll be careful.
I do hope it will be possible for me to hide deeper in the dream...
What is UP?! Glad you made it, bros. But...the dream world ends here.
Unless...you got one more Dream Egg? Didja? Didja snag that bad boy?
Oh, OK... Didn't snag it yet, huh. Go find the Dreampoint where it is!
You want me to warp you back to the entrance of this dream world?

I started to get worried, so I came to check on you.
Wow!
You've opened the entrance... Let's see what's waiting down there...
We've come a long way, so Bowser probably can't find us in here.
But... Who knows what lies ahead...
It might be wise to save just in case.
Ohh...
Not one, but deux gentleman callers. I am popular, honh?

Now, Mario... Let's relax and have a chat, hm?
You have time to spare, no?
Tee hee hee...
NYAHAHA!
You guys...still don't get it?
Surprise! Didn't expect Peach to be an impostor, did you?
We've played you all for fools!
Ooh, are you poor things in shock?
I pretended to be Peach to smuggle monsters into the dream world...
And to bring you to the deepest end of this place! Nyahahahaha!
What? You think I just wanted to wear this?
Actually... Yeah, you know, this frilly pink thing is pretty darn cute, I must say.
I mean, those blue robes are so DRAB. Sometimes I open the closet and just gag.
Wait...
HEY!
Let's start over...
All right! I'm serious now! Are you ready to surrender?
In that case, troops! Deal with these two!
Show the true power of Bowser's honor guard!
Hoo boy!
It's our big chance!
For real, guys, if we can finish them here...
I don't wanna jinx it, but PROMOTION CITY!
Wait, what? I thought you said our career paths were already solid!
Yeah, listen, about that...
Time out! Strategy meeting! Mario, we need a second!
Stay RIGHT there.
Look, we're already honor guards. Right? But if we nail this fight...
We are talking about sitting at the big table! In head-honcho chairs!
H-head honchos?!
You mean we might even be Kamek's superiors?!
YES, man!
We could even be BOWSER'S superiors!
Oh, wow! Let's go stomp those guys! I would LOVE to boss around Bowser!
Mario! We're back! Thanks for waiting!
Hey... Is he DOODLING? Don't doodle at us!
HONCHO TIME!
Ugh, what are you guys DOING? Look at yourselves! Pathetic!
You think a bunch of weaklings are fit to guard Bowser?!
NOPE! You guys are CANNED! You no longer lead the guards!
You're on KP duty until further notice! Go clean Bowser's castle!
No! Kamek! Forgive us!
AAARGH!
Hmph... Well, this isn't as much fun as I'd hoped.
But... Oh well. Who cares? This was just for kicks.
Because Bowser already kidnapped the real Peach!
Oh yeah! They're probably lounging in his new castle right this instant!
You chumps are no longer needed!
NYAAAHAHA!
That vile Kamek... He deceived us all...
No choice...
We'd better go back to the real world...
We need to think of a new strategy...
Hello! We have come for the Dream Egg...
OK, OK! Here goes!
You got a Dream Egg!
OK. Let's head for the next Dreampoint and find the next Seadring!
Now we have all three Dream Eggs!
Peach awaits us! Back to Seadric!
We have to expand the dream world immediately! The princess must be hidden!
Oh, totally! A Dream Egg expansion in the dream world is a perfect hiding spot!
Protecting a damsel in distress... Man.
That is JUST like the Super Seadrings!
That's even part of the theme song! "Ringin' It Up on Damsel Duty!"
Uhh... Really?
Yup!
"Triple the colors, triple the beards! Damsels in distress, have no fear!"
"Super Seadring dream team, form it up! Grab evil by its ear and RING! IT! UP!"
Just...stop posing like that. It's totally wrong and bad.
Anyhow, good luck, you three!
I've got some NEW heroes to root for!
NICE!
Red and green staches, little orange guy...
You guys must be...those superheroes! YES! The...
SUPER SEADRINGS!
Ummm... No, we need the Dream Egg and—
No need to hide your identities! I'm cool! I watch your show every single week!
Red Seadring! Green Seadring!
And Orange Seadring! Yeah! Always snacking on cheese!
Look, I'm Seatoon! HUGE FAN! This is, like, a massive honor!
Cheese...what? Look... Kid...
DUDE!
RING IT UP!
Transform into your super forms! OH PLEASE! With the poses!
Yes, I know... He's nuts. Let's just play along...
Ahem!
You are correct, young Seatoon! We are the Super Seadrings!
We need the Dream Eggs to defeat the evil monster, Biggidy-Bowser!
OH MY GOSH! THE REAL DEAL!
Dream Eggs, huh? They're the key?
Well, I've got one for you for sure!
But... First...
Mario... Yes, this is silly... But back me up here...
TRANSFORMATION TIME! Red Seadring, uh...RING IT UP!
Do it, Mario!
Guuuuuuulp... Oh my gosh...
Mario... He's waiting... Don't overthink the pose...
Just make something up or the ruse is done for!
No.
Not right AT ALL!
That's GREEN Seadring's pose! For after his special move!
Wow... So close, but so wrong...
Ma-Mario! I mean, Red Seadring! Enough warm-ups! Do the real thing!
And, Green! Look alive, superhero! Pose like you mean it!
Barf.
Still WRONG!
AND no transformation! AND unsynchronized!
Are...you...three... just...impostors?
I'm sorry, but yes... We're actually...
Right... Yeah, you DID look off... Super Seadrings have full beards, too...
When I got the call about you three, I assumed you were, y'know, THEM...
But you guys really went for it, huh? You tried to make me happy, huh?
Now THAT is nice! You guys are nice!
And you said you needed a Dream Egg, right?
Well, lemme repay nice with nice! I'll give you my Dream Egg!
So... We're here for the Dream Egg?
Ooh! Ooh! An audience! Right this way, folks!
Sure, sure, the Dream Egg. I got it. I'm Seabury. Like "C" and a berry, OK?
Say hey, and speaking of berries... You guys look hungry, am I right?
Gotcha, gotcha. Don't like the berries. Cuz you're into the mushrooms, am I right?
Yeah, sure, of course! So I got you some seats in the Porridge Parlor. Know whyyy?
CUZ IT'S A MUSH ROOM!
Is a parlor even a room? Yukyukyukyukyukyuk!
Who cares, am I right? Funny either way, right?
Gee whiz, tough crowd up in here... Feel free to clap, or talk, or something.
I mean, pair of sharp staches like those, I figure you guys appreciate sharp wit.
Soooooo... Anyway... Say hey! You guys loving us Seadrings or what?
Well, little known fact for ya: Know why we're called Seadrings?
Check out the bod!
Can'tcha SEE... "D"...RINGS?
YUKYUKYUK! 
That's my man right there! He gets it! You feeling me there, buddy? Yeah!
That one's solid! I mean, we're technically coils and not really rings, but whatever.
All right, hang on, I've got another one! This is gonna slay you, I swear!
Buh? You'd rather hear about the Dream Egg than hear my jokes?
OK... I get it... Ice cold, man.
But whatever! Here, take it!
Say hey, so you're gonna use that Dream Egg to hide Peach, am I right?
Sure, sure. Well, be careful toting it. You don't want it to break on the way!
I'm sure you'll be fine, of course... You're on an errand for a royal lady!
Boy, ladies, am I right? All of 'em deserve that royal treatment, y'know?
Take my wife. When I proposed, I gave her a phone and sent a text that said...
RING ME 4 A RING RING!
What? C'mon! Like, a wedding ring for her rings? She'd "ring" me on the phone?
No? Nothing? You guys need to loosen up. You're in a dream world. Live a little!
And listen... Jokes are like cheese, OK? Sometimes the best ones stink the most!
You got a Dream Egg! 
Now we have all three Dream Eggs!
Let's return to the dream world where Peach awaits.
OK! Let's make for the next Dreampoint and continue our Seadring search.
Hello, we're looking for a Dream Egg...
Oh hey! What up, guys? You're totally Mario, right?
I'm Seabelle. Or like, Ms. Seabelle? Or Sea-Sea, or whatever!
Yah, so, my brother? Seadric? He told me you were coming?
Right, and so I totally prepped a sweet Dream Egg for you!
Wow! In that case, if you could ju—
Oh wow. Ugh. Hold up, you guys. My eyelash extension just slipped!
I gotta, like, go redo my makeup? It'll only take, like, an hour. Ta-ta!
WHOA.
O...K. I guess you need the Dream Egg bad, huh?
But see, the thing is? In an hour, I'll be, like, an aquatic supermodel.
Oh... Really.
So that's, like, worth waiting an hour for, right?
Wait... Are you guys saying, like, I'm a supermodel even with this janky eyelash?
Um... Is she serious?
Hey! Cushion! You better be whispering I'm a supermodel, or no Dream Egg!
I, uh... Me?! You want me to tell her that?!
Say it! Like, now!
"Seabelle is a total supermodel even with a janky fake eyelash and no makeup!"
SAY IT.
Um... OK...
Seabelle is a...total supermodel...even with a janky fake eyelash and no makeup!
CAN'T HEAR YOU!
Seabelle is a total supermodel even with a janky fake eyelash and no makeup!
LOUDER!
SEABELLE IS A TOTAL SUPERMODEL, GAHHHH!
Ohhh! You think so? Really? I'm that cute?
There, I said it, didn't I? Now can we have the Dream Egg?
Well, I'm not sure you were, like, sincere? But you WERE super enthusiastic, so...
Egg time! Here ya go!
You got a Dream Egg!
Great!
Now we have three Dream Eggs!
Let's go back to where Seadric and the princess await in the first dream world.
OK. We'd better head for the next Dreampoint to find the next Seadring!
So next time? We should totally meet up when I'm, like, fully decked out, right?
For someone who thinks I'm a total supermodel, you're like, an ice cube.
So I have this dream? A superhot knight on a white horse comes for me...
And this knight is like, the total opposite of this phony cushion prince I know!
Deep dream, huh?! YEAH. MEANINGFUL.
Oh, whatever... Listen, you guys?
I can totally tell you think I'm annoying, right?
And I don't care! I'm going clubbing!
Phew... She was a handful...

Long have I awaited you! The time for practice is over!
The ideal spot to make the Ultibed is right through here.
Abide here.
I must focus... Look within...
I put this here... and then do that...
TRAGEDY!
The switch is too high...
What to do...
BEDSMITH! CAN'T! REACH!
Might you find a way to activate that switch?
WOWWW! CRRAZY!
BEDSMITH! IS! THRILLSMITH!
Come, this way.
Follow me.
Something is necessary should you wish to hit it.
Ready at last!
Produce the five parts that make the Ultibed!
Quite a load.
Astounding.
To run around so laden is no mean feat...
MMPH! HOOGA!
It is well!
I must make my bed in private! Wait here!
I do not joke...
Not even a peek!
I must focus in order to make the Ultibed.
The eyes of others will distract me.
And all is well! The bed is made!
You got the Ultibed!
Dreamy!
At last, we have the Ultibed!
Ready to sleep on it and meet the Zeekeeper?
Excellent! Let us go find him then!
Halt!
You seek to use the bed to meet with the Zeekeeper?
This cannot be done here.
You must find a place within the woods where dream power swells!
Strong dream power within the woods...
The Pi'illo Temple!
That place must be a font of dream power!
Yes, the Pi'illo Temple should serve well!
Mario! Luigi!
Explore the woods...
Find the Pi'illo Temple!
If we use the Ultibed there and go to the dream world...
I sense we shall find the Zeekeeper!
Many traps are said to guard the temple.
The way will be hard! Bedsmith pulls for you!
Beware the pools of water that surround the temple!
A nasty shock awaits he who breaks the surface.
You succeeded! You met the Zeekeeper!
Congratulations! Bedsmith had faith!
All of the Pi'illo folk have been saved!
Thank you so much, Mario and Luigi!
Hurry to Mushrise Park and tell Eldream!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
How delightful, to move again! 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Hm? Ah!
GLORY!
I can move! I move once more!
Thank you, brave ones!
To be petrified for so long was a grave trial.
I owe you a great debt for your help!
Who would have thought immobility would be so bad...
There was a great clamor, and the ground shook...
What could have befallen our Pi'illo Island...

Wait! That is...
A Pi'illo Master!
They, too, failed to escape petrification...
The temple...
To enter, we must save that Pi'illo.
Find a way up there!
So if we save this Pi'illo, we can enter the temple?
Correct.
This Pi'illo is at one with the spiritual plane...
A Pi'illo Master, eternal protector of the temple.
Without the Pi'illo Masters, the path to the temple will stay shut to us.
Mario! Luigi!
Let us rescue the Pi'illo Master!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
What is your need? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Ahhhh...
Life returns to my form...
I offer you my thanks.
I am a Pi'illo Master, guardian of the temple.
Greetings, Master.
Prince Dreambert! Did you escape our fate?!
No, not exactly...
Mario and his friends revived me as well.
Oh, I see...
Master.
We must reach the temple.
Will you aid us?
The temple...
Great need drives you. I will give you this.
It will set you on the path to the temple.
Our thanks.
There are others...
The other Pi'illo Masters were also petrified.
You must not leave them to their stony fates!
I beg of you, save the other Pi'illo Masters!
You saved all the Pi'illo Masters!
Our deepest thanks!
You have brought Antasma to bay!
Now finish this!
Correct.
Mario! Luigi!
We must rescue the others and head to the temple!
You got a Somnom Stone!
Huh? What is it? 
Talk to me

Ah... Nice...
Ah... Ummm... Thanks...
Umm... I was petrified...

I wonder...what fate... has in store...

We're on a mission. Can we go through?
Suddenly round!

Um, no...
Here to steal treasure!
Here to steal Nom Pi'illo!
Pilferers!
Pilferers? That not word.
Nom Pi'illo never yours!
Nom Pi'illo!
NOM PI'ILLO!
What in the world...
They didn't seem friendly at ALL...
They are Nommons. They have ever dwelt here.
But... I have no sense of this "Nom Pi'illo" they speak of...
A mystery...but we cannot linger. We must move on!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
Hm? What is it? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Nothing
Huh? Where... Where am I?
What was I doing until this moment?
Hmm... I have no memory of it...
Huh? What are you people doing here?
You say I was trapped in a nightmare chunk...
And you rescued me?
Hmm... I remember none of that...

The nightmare recedes at last!
I understand... Dire news...
And this is why you must reach the temple?
Very well.
In that case, take this.
We Pi'illo Masters are wards...
Long have we guarded the Somnom Stones, the keys to the temple.
With them, the way inside should open to you!
You will need many Somnom Stones to gain access to the temple.
Other petrified Pi'illo Masters lie along the path...
Help them all, and they will surely make gifts of the Somnom Stones.
You'll need the help of many Masters to reach the temple.
I will watch over you from here.
Antasma's ultimate defeat looms!
Do not relax until it is truly over!
You got a Somnom Stone!
Place stones...
Create a path.

Touch and hold the stone...

Once stones are placed, the path will be complete.
Select an already- placed stone...
And you can move it again.
Tap the button down below...
This rotates the selected stone.
Select, place, and rotate stones...
This is how one creates a path.
Would you hear the instruction again? 
No          
Yes
Then begin.

Nommon stroll. You stroll?
Nommon smell flowers. But Nommon no like.

You need to enter the temple to meet the Zeekeeper, yes?
I understand.

Master Zeekeeper...
He made his home in these woods, once...
He saved this island countless times...
Always would he recover in the temple...
Do not worry!
Master Zeekeeper will surely help us once more!
You got a Somnom Stone!
When you see Master Zeekeeper, please pay him my respects.
The castle has fallen from the sky! Wondrous news!
Master Zeekeeper is indeed amazing!

So listen... We need to reach the temple deep in the woods...
Ah, I see...
You plan to seek the Zeekeeper there...
If that is your quest, you will need this!
The dream power in these woods dwarfs any other part of the world.
That is why we built the temple here... To magnify the dream...
The dream current always runs strongly in the temple.
And if you have the Ultibed to boost your sleep power...
Surely you will be able to find the Zeekeeper!
I beg of you...
Save the world from the hands of evil!

You...have hair under nostrils...
How grow that?! Nommon want!
Nommon always fall in pools.

Nose-beards... No touch. Not.
Sorry! Nom!

In that case, I should give you this.
It is shocking news indeed to hear of Antasma's revival...
Antasma was once but a tiny bat living on the island...
But one day, he somehow consumed a Pi'illo's nightmare...
He developed a taste for dark dreams and ate more...
Over time, they transformed him into the horror he is now.
We managed to imprison him once, but he has returned...
Please stop his vile ambitions!
We need you!
You got a Somnom Stone!
Antasma is not to be trifled with.
Please be careful!
I heard you have cornered Antasma!
That is amazing!
Nommon respect big play!
You play big, you ARE big!
Nommon big busy!
Bury rock. Dig up. Dig-rock game fun.
Fun game is job. Job is fun game.

Behold the Pi'illo Temple.
Look, in the center!
A hugely powerful aura emanates from there.
This temple will be our gate to the Zeekeeper!
What is this thing?
It stands in the way of where we must place the bed...
Hmm...
Yes, the bed must go there, but...
Mario! Can you help?
Uh-oh...
Pi'illodium!
What IS that?!
A defense weapon created during the Pi'illo Kingdom era.
It has likely protected this place since that time...
Looks serious!
Mario! Luigi! Be careful!
Now the way's clear, huh?
Mario!
We must bring back the Zeekeeper from the dream world!
Most of the castle has collapsed already!
Quickly!
EEEEK!
Eh? Sleeptalking again?
What? Turn your nose?
That must be one weird dream...
Try spinning Luigi's nose around!
Hey!
I think something's wrong with Luigi!
Ehh?!
I need to do something? I don't know what to do!
I should just touch Luigi?
Errr...
Touch various parts of Luigi's head!
Press and hold the L on Luigi's cap!
Eh?!
I should touch the L on Luigi's cap?!
Press and hold the L on Luigi's cap!
Luigi?! Are you OK?
I wonder if I should touch that shining spot again...
Oh... Adorable. Talking in his sleep.
Huh? Scratch your nose?!
First the stache, now the nose?! What're you, five years old?!
Fine! For now I'll humor whatever weird sleep requests you make!
Right here? On your schnozz? Well, here goes nothing!
Try scratching Luigi's nose!
Peach... Mario... I hope they're OK...
Y'know, seeing Luigi zonked out is really starting to annoy me!
None of this would've happened if you'd stayed awake, snoozy!
Hrgh! Be more useful, you lazy mustache!
How can you sleep at a time like this?!
You sloth stache! Have another tweak!
Done! Castle has been thoroughly peeped.
It's just like you said. Time to shatter the barrier that guards it.
Very well!
Mario! Luigi! Onward!
Are you ready? 
No          
Yes
Oh man, come ON! You aren't ready?!
Look, I'll wait here, but hurry up, OK?
All righty! Let's DO it!
HERE WE GO!
Hey, what's up? I've been waiting.
It is time! We go!
Well done, destroying that formidable barrier!
You have our thanks, most revered Zeekeeper!
Hoff... Haff... That was...tough...
Been a while since I unleashed the Wakebeam... I'm out of shape.
I assume Bowser's castle landed somewhere nearby...
Head that way, and you should be able to get inside...
Whatever your fate, it's all you. My job here is done...
Huffff... Haaarff... Sorry... I've gotta rest up...
Of course! Leave the rest to us!
Now we can get into Bowser's castle!
We finally have Bowser and his guys on the ropes!
He's going to regret trying to conquer the world!
He will.
Mario. Luigi. Onward!
COMMERCE!
What was that?
Is that guy setting up shop in front of Bowser's castle?
Impressive...
What is it?
Look, I am BEAT. I need sleep.
Hit Torkscrew with the drill! Don't let it get away!
I wanna go too!
Don't leave me!
Big bro! Big bro!
My bro rocks!
Big bro!
Wait for me! Big broooo!
It's probably dangerous ahead!
You may not be able to come back...
You can leave if you jump toward that light...
I don't know what's up ahead...
Heeeelp!
Big bro... It's your choice...
Luigi... will follow you...
We're all here for you, bro. Always.
I wanna go too!
Don't leave me!
Big bro!
My bro rules...
Big bro!
I wanna go too!
Don't leave me!
Big bro! Big bro!
Bro is smooth...
Big bro!
Big bro... Let's go!
Are you... Dreamy Luigi?
No, no... This place is getting to my head.
Mario! Dreamy Luigi! We need to keep going!
Peach must be up ahead.
You saved Bedsmith!
Pi'illo folk saved: 
Now. Smash this chunk to save Bedsmith!
BEDSMITH! IS! FREEEE!
THANK YOUUUU!
Mario!
Have you heard of centrifugal force?
Try jumping off of the pole while it's spinning.
You should be able to jump even farther!
But you must time it just right.
It is definitely worth a shot.
Can you spot the odd one out?
Your test does not end yet...
I will let you go no closer...
I am the administrator of this island, Dr. Snoozemore...
Mm-yes, and I should like to tell you of the island's lore...
A long time ago on this island...
The Pi'illo folk lived in this place and called it the Pi'illo Kingdom.
But then, over a short span...
The Pi'illo Kingdom suddenly fell and was no more...
What happened to the Pi'illo Kingdom? Mm-yes, this question lingers.
It is but one of the mysteries that we are actively trying to solve today...
Indeed, another of these mysteries sleeps deep within Pi'illo Castle...
Some say a treasure hides there since the time of the Pi'illo Kingdom...
The deeper passages have only recently been discovered.
What treasure do you suppose sleeps in this cazzzzz...zzZZzz.
Now, on the island there existed two stones...
The Dream and Dark Stones, both granters of wishes.
The Dream Stone was formed of happy dreams...
The Dark Stone, a solid manifestation of nightmares...
The safekeeping of these stones was tasked to us...
But we grew lax, and one day the bat king, Antasma, stole the Dark Stone...
He sought to fulfill his own wish!
At great risk and great cost, we fought and cornered him...
But just as Antasma was to be imprisoned in the dream world...
He shattered the stolen Dark Stone!
And then...our true doom came to pass.
A black rain of nightmare chunks from the Dark Stone fell all over the island...
As we were exposed to the chunks, we were all of us petrified...
As I said before...
The evil bat-king, Antasma, wanted to fulfill his wishes...
He stole the Dark Stone, but my people imprisoned him...
Just before he was banished, Antasma crushed the Dark Stone...
The falling chunks of nightmare turned us all into stone...
But we succeeded in imprisoning Antasma in the dream world!
Even so... We knew he would live on within the dream world...
We knew he would wait for his bonds to weaken...
And when they did, he would have his chance to return!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
How goes it? 
Talk to me 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
Sweet release! Thank you much!
I owe you...mightily! Take this with you!
You got a Dozite!
There's one gatekeeper left. Could you save him as well?
There are two gatekeepers left. Would you save them?
Mmmm... The desert has changed quite a bit since last I saw it.
I can't believe someone would try to steal the Dream Stone.
You rescued us all! Many thanks!
This whole situation is a monstrous mess...
These might be the last days of Pi'illo Island!
You must put a leash on Antasma. You must!
We barely contained him the last time...
So Antasma is finally going down?
I hope he learns his lesson.
Listen up, everybody!
A large horned creature has been reported in this area!
If you see it, alert your supervisor!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
SUPERVISOOOOR!
Gracious! What was that?!
Do such creatures live in this land now?
MARIOOOOOOO! Everything OK in there?
Wonder if he made it to the bottom of the dream world...
CONTACT!
FOUND 'EM!
Ha!
Napping, are we? My, how comfy!
Hey, it's you guys! Why are YOU here?!
Excuse me?! Ease up on the attitude, huh?
Are you implying we SHOULDN'T be here?!
Oh, why, did you get an invite to this island, too?
Somehow I doubt it... I bet you heard about it...
Yeah, I bet you just invited yourselves!
Affirmative!
We got intel about an interesting little island...
So we escorted Lord Bowser straightaway!
Any complaints about it should be lodged with our elite fists!
Elite?!
I KNOW!
Bowser promoted all three of us!
We're his elite personal guard!
I'm not feeling much eliteness...
Enough blabbering!
His Grouchiness approaches even as we speak!
His horns gleam with fury! His spikes sparkle with malice!
Any second now!
His Timeliness comes!
Bowser!
Wh-what do you want?!
Give it to me straight. Princess Peach is gone?
Hello? That is MY thing! Only I get to kidnap her!
TREASON!
You heard that rumor and came here to find her?
Sorry... Mario escorted her back to safety!
Sooo... You're out of luck! Go have a nap on the beach!
BAH!
I hate beaches as much as I hate your voice!
But I don't have time to deal with you now.
See, kidnapping Princess Peach is my calling in life!
I don't care what you did; I'll find her and nab her!
What's this stupid warpy thing?
No! Back! Stay away!
WHIFF!
That warpy thing smells like her perfume!
Oh yeah, she's in there. I'm sure of it!
N-nuh-uh!
You think I'll let Mario find her before me?!
Oh, excuse me for just a moment!

First, peep at the Touch Screen and choose a pic to decrypt.
At first, you can only choose Lv. 1.
So listen: select Wakeport Lv. 1, and then enter the puzzle screen.
Here's where we puzzle those pics out.
Touch one of the scraps scattered around on the Touch Screen...
Then just drag that scrap over to the panel.
Once you find the spot where the scrap locks in, well, that's its home.
Oh, and, fellas, rotate the selected scrap by touching the icon down below.
Some of those scraps will need some rotation before they find their homes...
Easy-peasy, right? Coupla geniuses like you, you'll solve 'em all easy.
Or maybe... Need instructions again? 
No          
Yes
Once you boys complete Lv. 1, you can challenge the next level.
That ain't all! If you complete a puzzle within the target time...
Well, ol' Kylie here will lay a few coins and prizes on ya!
So whatcha say? If you're ready, lend me a hand, will ya?!

We will stay here until the Dreambeats cease.
The peril is too great to go out now!
Wh-what?! NO!
The... The dream portal! It disappeared!
An ill omen...
The power of the Dreambeats must have been too great...
Luigi's sleep became so profound that the dream portal ceased to be.
Hm.
We cannot return to the real world with things as they are.
We must seek a way to reopen the dream portal!
Phew...
A heated battle!
The dream portal is finally back!
We can now return to the real world!
...But what awaits us?
Let us make haste!

Drink water from the fountain? 
No          
Yes
The fresh, sweet taste and lovely scent of the water courses through Mario's and Luigi's bodies, plunging them into a deep sleep.
In time, a pleasant smell wafts into their noses and pulls them from their deep slumber.
Lured by the wonderful scent, Mario and Luigi press forward. Their bodies feel oddly light. Their legs flex into the earth. Their mustaches flutter like gossamer in the mountain breeze. The smell grows stronger. They travel for great leagues... Or do they barely travel at all? Soon they find the smell's source.
They find endless mushrooms. An unimaginable mound of mushrooms. MUSHROOMS! Mario jumps onto the mushroom pile... Luigi leaps onto the mushroom pile... They chew and inhale mushrooms... They devour as many as they can, their banquet interrupted by no one.
They know not how much they ate. A white cloud appears beside Mario. His gloves caress the atmosphere. His soaking boots absorb the sea. Hills shrink... No! The bros are huge! They have grown as big as the island! Thousands of times bigger than life! A finger flick could smash Bowser! There is nothing for them to fear. In this moment, they are ecstatic.
Soon after that, they realize they cannot go back to normal...
In a rush of ecstatic happiness, their HP and BP are fully restored!
The fresh, sweet taste and lovely scent of the water courses through Mario's and Luigi's bodies, plunging them into a deep sleep.
After a while, Mario and Luigi awake feeling an unusual power deep within their bodies.
After becoming so powerful that they could crush anything in their paths, Mario and Luigi move on! Bowser and Antasma are still on the run, but their capture by Mario and Luigi is inevitable. All Bowser and Antasma can do now is blame one another for failure.
Bowser and Antasma are cornered with ease, but still they wish upon the Dream Stone for the bros' downfall. But of course, Luigi the superstar doesn't miss his chance to shine! He leaps gracefully into the air, and with otherworldly agility, he manages to take the Dream Stone back!
Bowser and Antasma reach the very nadir of utter failure. The bros were just too strong. Prince Dreambert revives all the petrified Pi'illos with the Dream Stone and welcomes scores of tourists to the island. Pi'illo Island becomes famous, and the party never ends.
Pi'illo Island finally wakes up from its nightmare.
Dreaming dreamy dreams fully restored HP and BP!

Ah! You can harness the wind power to stick to the wall!
Well...
When you spin Luigi's nose, the propeller spins, so...
Perhaps it might stop if you pushed on his nose?
I suppose... Since it looks like a propeller, it would probably spin...
It wouldn't be the first Luiginary Work that involved spinning...

Gaze upon the inner reaches of Dreamy Somnom Woods!
The most sacred area of the most sacred of dream worlds...
Yes. Only those who sleep upon the Ultibed can breach its border!
And that is for good reason... For the Zeekeeper is atop this tree!
Just crazy, right?! Crazy with a capital NUTS!
I'm talking THE Zeekeeper! You wanna see it, right?
Yes... Astute. It is VERY tall. Climbing it will be a trial.
Yet a worthy one! For you will meet the Zeekeeper!
I must caution you, however. It is easy to lose one's way here.
Know that dead ends may not be ends, and hidden paths abound...
Back already?
Mm? Up above? You were stymied?
A hidden trail must have escaped your gaze...
You must be vigilant... Use eyes and mind...
A path exists, to be sure. Even if it is winding...
Mm? You wonder how high this tree reaches to the sky?
Well... Not even I know the answer to that question...
Reach the top, and your eyes will gaze upon the Zeekeeper!
We surely draw near to the Zeekeeper.
I feel a great power emanating from the tree's topmost bough!
BOOM! WHACKA! I FEEEEEL IT!
I'll tell you what else I feel: an epic nap coming on.
I know it is your wish to meet the Zeekeeper, and I hope it comes to pass!
But that was not all I hoped... No, no... For I, too, had a wish I wished...
With the Ultibed built and my task done... I feel a reward is forthcoming.
Dreambert.
LET ME NAP ON YOU JUST ONCE!
That legendary royal fluffiness! A quick nap is all I'm asking!
PLEASE!
Too weird? How about a Pi'illo fight? We'll just tussle a little bit! C'mon!
YAAACK!
WAIT!
Ugh... Blew it...
The power that pulses from the top of this tree...
It can only be...the power of the Zeekeeper.
A shortcut! Well done!
You really get things done!
That...makes... me want to...
This should make it easier for us to go up and down.
NAP ON YOU GUYS!
Just a joke! Heh. Joking!
Too weird?
Heh! Never been napped on? It's just a Pi'illo expression...
Anyway, there is still far to go. Perhaps you should take a break?
Even if one cannot nap on one's friends, rest is still important!
You have come so far!
The life force of this tree astounds me. Such sturdy branches support us!
We have almost reached the very apex of the tree!
BEDSMITH! IS! SNOOZY!
But alas, no time for napping! We must see the Zeekeeper...
And until we can enlist his aid, we mustn't drop our guard...
WAKE! WARE!
Vigilance is the watchword, whether one chases dreams, love, or the perfect nap...
(peek)
Mario! 
Look back and the path is lost.
Coins lead ever forward... Monsters point treasureward...

Look, another Luiginary Work...
I will enlighten you if you have questions.
First, Dreamy Luigi must become one with the Luiginary Work.
Press the R Button to swap action icons and then the B Button to enter it.
Might there be anything to be done in the real world?
This is... Wait! Gravity is gone?
Mario... Can you move?
Looks like you can barely change your heading with the Circle Pad...
How about swimming? Can you do that?
Enlightening. An air swim. This fascinates me.
Though it feels alien, relax! Stay limber and move on.
Mario!
Turn back! I see clearly! We can use the floor!
Press the A Button while sliding the Circle Pad toward the floor!
And so it shall be!
This will allow you to leap with power!
Wh-what is this?
You dare attempt to take me down?!
I won't fall to you in here of all places!
Attack!
Kee-youch!
Well, no matter! I'll escape to another dream world!
I'll get you next time!
Very good! I sense something might have changed in the real world.
Let us return!
Mario! Luigi!
What's wrong? It's me, Peach!
I'm a...damsel! Save me!
OK, I guess you wouldn't bite on that again!
Kyahahaha!
Next time won't be so easy!
OK, no more playing tag!
This ends here and now!
I'm serious this time! No holding back!
Bow...ser...
This cannot be...the end... Not for me...
I must...give...my magic... to His Churlishness...
Ugh... Argh...
MARIO!
Even here? In my DREAMS? Typical. You are the worst.
Well, FINE!
You wanna know what's in this head, pal? FEAR!
GROW!
Now go crush them both!
GWAHAHAHA!
Onh! Monsieur Mario! Zis must be destiny, oui?
I have been looking for an empty lot for zee store expansion...
And zen BOM! A castle appears! Zis is just incroyable, oui?
Oui, but inside is zee labyrinth! Zere are zee twists and turns!
I must say, zis monsieur felt too lonely in zere!
Ah oui, buy something, s'il vous plaît!!
What is zis you want? 
Items 
Gear 
Pi'i-latte          
Never mind
It's 10 coins, oui? 
No          
Yes
You lack zee coins...
    HP and BP fully restored!    
Lord Bowser!
We prepped some juicy, tender, power-upping meats for you!
Ha! Man, being in my dream just plain rules!
Look at all this meat! I can eat all I want!
YUM!
BAAAARP! Not bad!
Now more! More meat!
Mario! Really? You made it here?!
Hey! You! Minions! Make with the meat!
I've gotta power up to smash this guy!
O-OK... Yes, sir!
AAAAAH!
More! MOOOORE!
Gotta get stronger to stomp Mario!
Order up!
Extra large!
SNARF! MONCH!
Not done yet! Gotta get bigger!
Lord Bowser!
Um... Uhhhh...
No more meat.
GRAAWR!
MUST GET BIGGERRR!
GOTTA CRUSH MARIO WITH A SINGLE PUNCH!
MORE MEEEAT!
L-L-L-L-Lord Bowser!
No! A fall from here would be...fatal!
What... Did he... fall to his doom?
Well... That worked out! Back to the real world!
No doubt Antasma's power has weakened!
Dreamy Bowser is no more! Return to the real world!
HNNGARRR!
Time to give up hope, Mario! In my dreams, I fear nothing!
I can crush even you like a little red bug!
Bowser... Master...
Kee... Kee hee hee... You've grown so big...
I will...use my magic... to make you greater!
GRAAAWR!
With my bro!
MY BIG BRO!
I'll do my best!
DO MY BEST!
Let's go, bro!
LET'S GO, BRO!
Big bro!
You are one with greatness!
Antasma's energy has surely grown weaker this time!
It is finally time for the final battle with Antasma!
Let's return to the real world!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
This thing's levitating! 
Hey!
What's going on in there?
Press and hold the L on Luigi's cap!
Luigi?! What is it? Another nightmare?
You seem...so confident! Way different than usual...
Are you...fighting Bowser? Well, give it your all!
Aw, dis is brutal! Talk about a disaster!
Wicked nor'easter blew dese rocks all over!
We gotta get out in front a dis mess!
GET CRACKIN'!
We gotta get ridda all dese boulders by sundown!
Sun...down?!
DID I STUTTER?!
Or is it...
Maybe you don't like orders, huh? From ya...
SUPERVISOR?!
N-no, sir! Cleaning up, sir!
Bah! Now who's dis?!
I ain't got time to chitchat, pal!
I gotta start breakin' dese boulders up.
What's dat now?
Hey!
BAH!
You haven't seen a special pillow around, have you?
It's a really old pillow. Probably musty and stiff.
It might be somewhere inside this park.
Uh... Dis thing?
Dere are a bunch of 'em round da park.
I'm really lovin' dis one in particular.
Thing just seems, like... historical or somethin'!
That's what we're looking for!
Psssh!
You show up here, in my park, wantin' my special pillow?
You gotta lotta nerve! Like I ain't already got a full plate!
Tell you what. You want it? Ya gonna hafta TAKE it!
NO! WAIT!
Mario! Luigi! After him!
OW!
The feathers fell off, and the power's out!
The fountain stopped too!
The flowers were the pride of the park! What do we do?!
Afternoon, Mr. Mario! Hey, Mr. Luigi!
Past here, you'll see the clock-tower plaza.
It's super popular... though I can't see why.
Y'know, me and this guy got to chatting and became pals!
When that castle showed up, we took off together.
I guess that's how you make a traveling buddy, huh?
The clock tower over there is the worst tourist attraction...
Wanna know what it's called? "Ordinary Clock Tower."
And yup, that's what it is! Talk about weak...
Before we left the Mushroom Kingdom to come to this island...
I never thought I'd live to see something so scary!
Well, I guess scary things happen back home, but still...
Y'know how you just KNOW a spot is going to disappoint you...
But you get excited wondering HOW disappointing it'll be?
As you can see, we're all doing just fine.
I wonder if Princess Peach is safe...
Well, you guys are on the job, so she'll be OK!
We need to run away! Quick, to the blimport!
Calm down! Just chill! Everything will be fine!
Stay calm? STAY CALM?! Three islands just vanished!
Well, these two heroes are on THIS island, right?
You just know they're gonna deal with that castle, dude!
Hey, that's true! Why do I always panic?!
I never learn!
Take care of business, Mr. Mario!
Good luck, Mr. Luigi!
You probably know lots of Pi'illo ruins are on this island.
Yeah, while a lot of this place is developed for visitors...
Somnom Woods is basically untouched by tourism.
I bet the forest is amazingly mystical and spooky!
That castle's beam vaporized three of the barrier islands!
There were ruins and rare plants there... Now all gone.
Hello! Need any directions for getting around town?
North (↑) is the tour center! East (→) is the shop district!
South (↓) is the event stage! Hope that helps!
I didn't know WHAT to do when that castle appeared.
Mr. Toad here helped me stay cool and evacuate!
What a great guy... I would have totally lost it otherwise.
They say this wall was erected by Pi'illos in ancient times.
I love the way they left the ruins intact in this town...
Blending them in with the new buildings... Brilliant move!
Wait... The wall is gone!
I wonder why that castle appeared all of a sudden?!
I mean, if you're gonna build a sky castle...
At least spend the cash to build a nice-looking one!
Large bro is somewhere in town! Da, is certain!
He is master of local geography and ruins.
He is maybe in place where tourists can't go...
You must hunt large bro! Follow trail of beef!
I am the gatekeeper...
Reset the panels? 
No           
Yes
Are you sure? 
No          
Yes
You will be awed upon awakening!
The gate has opened. You may pass.
All panels are in their original spots...
Yes...
NOOO!
Oh... Ahh... Great...
You both dropped down...
I guess that's it... I'll just turn into dust in this foreign land...
I'm a grown Toad, and STILL I get lost...
So lost that I end up in a place like this!
I was so psyched to see you guys up there...
I was gonna ask you to pull me up out of here.
But you guys just jumped on down, didn't you...
Gosh, how are we gonna ever get out of here?
Mr. Mario! Mr. Luigi! Do something!
Whoa! That works!
Oh, you guys are just the best! The BEST!
Now I can go back whenever I want!
I guess I'll hang here VOLUNTARILY now!
There are three different gates to the ruins in this town.
Since I'm here, I might as well try to see all of them, huh? 
There he is, huh? Big Massif.
He's been napping here all along!
OK, let's wake this guy up!
Time to work! Wake UP!
WAKE UP!
MORNING!
YOU'RE LATE!
Wow! This guy won't wake up!
Something's not right...
You think he's just in a deep sleep?
I mean, he DOES seem to be sleeping, true...
But he's breathing really slow, right?
And I was just yelling, and he didn't move!
HNNGAH!
This place... Oh, I see! This is a Dreampoint!
This person... He could well sleep here forever!
What did you say?!
The Dreampoints have a very powerful dream aura...
It is rare, but sometimes they hold people in the dream.
Those who suffer such a fate end up like this one.
Except... I sense he has CHOSEN to remain there.
He doesn't want to wake up? What's he dreaming about?!
Beef... Stronger...
Daaa... Muscle up...
...Maybe it's better not to know...
Anyway, we have to wake him up!
We have no choice! We must wake him...
IN his dream!
First, we must find him in the dream world.
Then we must convince him to wake!
So we'll need to go inside Big Massif's dream?!
Is that even possible? Someone else's dream?
It is. Luigi, please try sleeping next to him.
If two sleep near one another on a Dreampoint...
It is possible for two people to have the same dream!
Perfect! That'll get us into Big Massif's dream world!
Very well, Luigi! Lay your head on me!
Mario! Luigi! Good luck!
Roust that guy from his dream!
Nngh...
Uh! Is too strong!
HRRGH!
We did it!
Uhhh, huhhh, hahhhhh... Is crazy nightmare!
Is just bad dream... Da, just dream...
Big Massif not lose like that!
JUST BAD DREAM!
Oh, truly? Are you sure, Big Massif?
UH!
Is like dream... Cutlets from dream!
Is enough to make brain melt like fondue...
But is no big deal...
So what are little shrimps doing here?
It's time to work! You're our tour guide!
OVERSLEEP!
Large bro returned. Is late but not never!
So now is time for Mount Pajamaja tour!
Da!
Is shameful, the oversleeping and tour lateness! Is bad.
Is amend-making time... I must do rare tour to...
BEEF!
BEEFIER!
BEEFIEST!
ULTRABEEF ASCENT!
Uh... Ultrabeef ascent, da? Large bro takes it to limit!
Da! Is time to start tour! Is time to flex muscles!
Ultrabeef ascent starts with warm-up for legs!
We sprint to trailhead like spicy hot links!
Mount Pajamaja is behind Pi'illo Castle! Is FYI.
Follow path around castle and you find mountain.
PAJAMAJA! BEEEEF!
Hey, wait up!
We'd better head to Mount Pajamaja too!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
Challenges to go: 
 
What are your needs? 
I want to talk 
Enter dream world 
Never mind
My nightmare is over. You have my thanks.
Huh? The Dream Stone is in danger?
Then we have no choice...
Please take this.
You got a Dozite!
There are three more gatekeepers. Each of them holds a Dozite.
You must collect all of the Dozites...
Only then will you be able to reach the Dream Stone.
I'll display the number of remaining gatekeepers here.
I sense the other gatekeepers are also imprisoned.
We're all counting on you.
I hope the Dream Stone is still in one piece...
Just one gatekeeper left! We're counting on you.
Two gatekeepers remain trapped. Please help them!
Three gatekeepers remain imprisoned. Please save them!
You've saved all of the gatekeepers!
We are grateful. 
The Dream Stone is making that castle float up there.
I can feel it. I've been guarding it for ages, you know...
I don't know what the future holds, but this is a bad omen indeed.
Antasma. He's the one behind all of this chaos.
You must defeat him!
Ha! It seems that you have Antasma cornered!
But approach cautiously! His darkness knows no depths.
What the huh?!
That, uh... That thing your guys' friend or something?
He looks like he works out. Guy could be a HUGE help.
Can you introduce me? Y'know, break the ice.
Oh... He ain't your friend?
Well then... GET BACK TO WORK!
Your hammer won't do squat against that thing.
You wanna calm it down, you're gonna hafta hit it with a drill.
Just think of how many rocks I could crush if I had that thing by my side. 
You need something, or what? 
Pay me 
Explain the job 
Never mind
Spit it out. 
Changing directions 
Calling the Drilldigger 
Flipping panels         
Never mind
We done here? 
Changing directions 
Calling the Drilldigger 
Flipping panels         
We're done
Just hit that thing over there to change direction.
Hit that switch over there with the drill to change directions.
You gotta time it right to get a good hit.
Hit that block over there to call the machine over.
It just takes a sec.
The panels are at crossroads like this.
The Drilldigger will go the same direction the arrow is pointing.
If you flip over the panel, the arrow will flip with it.
You follow?
You wanna flip a panel over, you gotta go underground.
So how many rocks you broke? Lemme see...
?
So how many rocks you broke? Lemme see...
?
All right. I'll give you 20 coins for every rock you broke. Take it.
You got 
 coins!
Not a rock in sight. Looks like you broke 'em all.
Never thought I'd say it, but you two did a bang-up job.
I'll throw in a little bonus for clearing out all them rocks.
You got 100 more coins! 
OK, enough of the mushy stuff. GET BACK TO WORK!
Lemme get this straight—you want ME to pay YOU for SLACKING OFF?!
YOU DIDN'T BREAK ANY ROCKS, BUB!
You want more coins? But you already broke all the rocks!
You tryin' ta swindle me, bub?
You need a drill to break the rocks around here.
Sometimes you'll find stuff under the rocks.
There's something over there too!
Maybe it's pirate treasure!
Wh-what was that th-th-thing?
I hope it doesn't eat c-c-cowards.
Not that I'm a coward.
First birds, now castles?! When did flying become cool? 
Every day there's some new emergency going on.
Makes it hard for a guy to get anything done.
My friend said she saw a horned monster around here.
It's funny how people make stuff up just for attention!
I thought I felt something huge run past me.
Nah, I'm just imagining things!
I thought I saw something huge hovering in the sky!
But then I thought, "Nah, it's all in my head!"
Well, I finally looked for that hovering thing in the sky...
There's nothing there! It was all in my head!
Wh-what is that thing?!
It swallowed the pillow, didn't it?
Grrrrr! We need that pillow!
Mario! Luigi! Chase after that thing!
GROOAAH!
Oh no... Bowser's transformed!
Unh! Yeah! I feel... POWER, BABY!
He absorbed it all... The Dream Stone's energy...
This goes ill! Starlow!
We must try to stop... him...if we can!
Mario! Luigi! Take Peach somewhere safe!
His... His power is just too much for us...
Well, at the least, I must lend Mario and Luigi aid...
    HP and BP fully restored!    
Check out my flame! Yeah! I am ROCKING this new look!
Oh man, I have so much power... I can do whatever I want!
Peach... This island... This world... All of it...
MINE!
And you guys are...
COOKED!
GRAAR!
Thank you, Mario! Thank you, Luigi!
Everyone on this island should be safe now!
Oh no! The castle is about to collapse!
We have to go!
Back to the path that brought us here! Hurry!
Pi'illo Island... Hrm... Can't say I've heard of it...
Princess!
I feel rather uneasy about this trip!
We still have time! Let's return home!
BROOF!
AAH!
Oh! Who's this?
Mm-yes, hello. Nice meeting you.
I am the proprietor of Pi'illo Island! I am Dr. Snoozemore anzzz...
zZz
Is he...asleep?
Oops!
Please excuse me...
As you may have guessed, I am researching the science of sleep.
Mm-yes, and on Pi'illo Island...
There's a special power that makes you sleep soundzzz...
A special sleep power?! What poppycock!
Scoundrel! Wake up and explain yourself!
Mm-heh heh...
This is no time for a lecture. Now, I ask that you relax...
Be at ease until you reach the island, and enjoy your trip...
Mm-heh... Yes, relax with the dog... Your fellow passengers...
And that OTHER passenger... He is VERY interesting... Mm-heh...
What's THAT?!
One day...
At Peach's Castle in the Mushroom Kingdom...
An invitation to Pi'illo Island was delivered in style.
-To Fair Princess Peach and Her Subjects- An island of luxury awaits: Pi'illo Island! Our staff wishes to wait on you! Come! Take a vacation with us! -From the Pi'illo Island Proprietor
The princess and some of her staff decided to take the trip to the island.
But little did they know what awaited them there...
Oh, yes! Of course! We can't forget these guys!

Driftwood Shore Shop Area
There they are!
Phew! There's no way they'll catch us now!
Let's take a breather!
Heh heh heh! Birds...
I sense that they're taking a break...
Yeah, and they put the sheets down.
Bowser's gonna flip when he sees what we got!
Yeah, I'm hoping for a promotion!
Heh heh heh... My shoulders hurt.
This is our chance. Let's take them down!
The only problem is...
If we fight them, we may damage the sheets.
Huh? You have a plan?
Mario! I had no idea you could be so...devious!
I love it. Let's get those sheets back.
Yeah!
I'm loving this weather!
Hey, have you heard?
Heard what, complete stranger?
The latest juicy rumor... ABOUT BOWSER?
Huh?
Well...
No way! 
A birthmark THERE? In the shape of THAT?
Oh, it gets better...
Wait... Where is Master Bowser's birthmark?!
AND WHAT SHAPE IS IT?!
I must know!
!!!
You retrieved the Driftwood Jellyfish Sheets!
THIEVES!
WE'RE the thieves?!
YOU'RE the thieves!
GIVE 'EM!
Good thing we got those sheets back!
Yes, I didn't foresee them being stolen from us...
These sheets look so soft!
Kinda surprising, considering...
You know...
I don't follow.
They're made of jellyfish!
They look soft, but they're probably all slimy and gross.
Er... Put it out of your mind, Luigi. Seriously.
The thread count on these sheets is off the charts.
Anyhow, our search for the other parts continues.
Let's look at the menu for info about the other parts!
This is the last part we need. We now have them all!
Now we just need to find the master bed crafter in Wakeport.
He's the only one who can assemble the five parts!
The master bed crafter... Yes, I remember now!
If memory serves, his name is Bedsmith.
He may also be trapped in a nightmare chunk.
Or he may be in the last place we expect him to be.
We'll need to search high and low to find him.
Next stop, Pi'illo Island!
WHOA!
That thing we just saw... Was that the Zeekeeper?!
We brought the Zeekeeper back!
AWK!
I ARRIVE!
What is UP?!
It's that Zeekeeper you know and love!
Your hero!
THE Zeekeeper!
Oh, wow! He's a little full of himself, huh?
I sort of imagined a more humble guardian...
Please.
Huh?! Snurffff!
I smell it... I SMELL IT!
That is a...
STANK!
The stench of pure evil, that's what that is...
It's like a stinky fog over the whole island!
Talk about being dramatic, geez...
Bowser's castle is near!
I ask that you blast it...
Destroy its barrier!
You're our last hope!
No need to be so theatrical about it...
This'll take two seconds. And then, bonus time!
Say what?
What bonus?
A pittance. Don't sweat the details right now...
I do believe it's time for reconnaissance!
I'm gonna go check out this castle real quick!
Good idea...
We will take our leave of the woods.
It won't take me long to get ready...
I'll wait for you near the entrance to the woods!
All right. See ya!
Let us away to the entrance to the woods!
Go to the dream world? 
No          
Yes
There it is! Bowser's castle!
What...
Dunno why, but...
I'M PEEVED!
Ooh, they roused the Zeekeeper! And the Zeekeeper rages!
Only the destruction of that barrier will slake my rage thirst!
Doom's coming for you! Oh, yeah, believe it!
Stare into its grim gaze! Witness the Wakebeam!
WAKE
UP!
AND BOOM!
TIME FOR A REAL...
COIN DREAM!
At last... SCREEP!
I vill use the Dream Stone to realize my dreams... SCREEK!
But first...
SCREENK! SCREET!
SCREE-EE-EEF!
Whoa! Buddy, what happened to you?!
Is that what you normally look like?!
Yesss... Now that I am back in this vorld...
I can return to my true form... SCREECH!
Heh! Not too bad! You look pretty evil!
Bowser... All that has come to pass is due to our meeting... SCREEP!
Und vee even got the Dream Stone in our claws! SCREEEKEEEE!
Vee should use the Dream Stone... right NOW! SCREEPEEE!
OK... How do we do that?
SCREEF! Vee must gather some energy for it first...
Vith collected energy, it vill grant us anything vee vant!
Anything I want, huh? I can get behind that!
What's on your wish list? Losing that screechy tic?
SCREECH! I vish...
TO CONQUER THE VORLD!
Hold up. What?
Buddy, you'd better wish again! I already claimed the world!
SCREEP! Perhaps I misspoke... I vill give you the vorld.
All I vish for is the freedom to spread my vings.
I vish to do anything I vant. Und then, I vill be happy.
Hm... OK by me!
BWAHAHAHA!
So we're square! Let's do it! We'll take over the world together!
Your Dreaminess!
We stand ready to make that wish come true, sire.
Good. In that case, let's get a mo—
Mario! And the green stache!
How'd you know we were here?!
It doesn't take a genius to anticipate your moves!
Now give us back the Dream Stone!
Antasma! It is an age since we faced off!
I know not how you contrived to come back to this world...
But you shall not stay long! I will return you to the dream world!
SCREEEEMBERT! You! Meddling vith me again...
Vee haff no time to play vith these creatures...
Vee must collect energy for the Dream Stone...
Hey, Mario! Luigi! Listen to THIS!
All...things...
MUST SLEEP!
What... What's that?! What's that music?!
Could those be... the Dreambeats?!
You are correct... The Dreambeats!
All who hear these beats vill fall asleep like rocks...
Ah... Sergeant Guy... reporting...for sleep...
Shouldn't be...so sleepy... I slept...a ton today...
King Bowser... Have... a...good...night...
Doesn't seem to affect me at all...
Wait, whoa! You guys are totally passing out!
You can't sleep now!
Wake up!
WAKE UP!
The Dreambeats have no effect on you or me...
But for normal creatures, the music is irresistible...
Things have gone ill! We are in danger!
We must retreat from this place!
But the Dream Stone!
It cannot be helped. I could handle Antasma...
But if Mario falls asleep, I cannot stop Bowser!
Understood! Let's bail!
Mario! Luigi! Wake up NOW!
Gahahaha! Look at 'em go! RUNNING WON'T SAVE YOU!
Huh? What're those weird things?
SCREEEPS! The Dream Orbs...
Dream...Orbs?
These vill allow us to absorb energy from those who sleep...
These Dream Orbs are the energy source that vill power the Dream Stone...
That's a lot of words, but OK. Sounds pretty sweet!
SCREEKEEDEE! Good. This is good!
Ve vill soon be able to use the Dream Stone. SCREEG!
Mario... Luigi... Are you guys OK?
Thank goodness!
Catching you guys at the last second... How cool was that?
Superheroes and superdeities always show up in the clutch.
Normally I'd have to hit you up for some extra coinage...
But I'm feeling pretty good. This time's on the house.
How nice am I? Seriously.
Th-thank you. You are VERY kind.
Well, now the island should become peaceful again!
PRIIIIINCESS!
This old boy was...
WORRIED SICK!
I'm sorry, dear Toadsworth. Thank you for thinking of me.
Princess Peach!
And Mr. Mario! And Mr. Luigi!
You're all OK! And you saved us!
Zee scary castle of Antasma and Bowser is no more!
And all is joy now, oui! Merci very much!
Now we concentrate on work without fear, honh?
Great Zeekeeper! Are you ready?!
What's that thing for?
I enlisted the help of all the island inhabitants...
We collected all the dust that burst from Bowser!
Oh...dear. I'm so sorry...
I feel awful that we had to break something so special...
Let your mind be at ease, Princess!
The Dream Stone can be restored!
Here, Zeekeeper!
Please restore the Dream Stone for us!
All right! Let's do this!
Bam! Check it! A DREAM COIN!
And with it, words of advice: Don't rely on the Dream Stone!
Don't rely on THINGS! Seriously. Rely on yourselves. On each other!
Throw away material crutches, and you guys will be better for it!
YOU FEEL ME?!
Anyway, every spiritual awakening needs some financial support...
So use it well! Use that Dream Coin to make all dreams come true!
COINS RULE!
I LOVE COINS!
Oh my...
Well, I suppose having a Dream Coin isn't so bad...
I agree.
And he's right. It's vital to be independent!
Hey, Dreambert! Things worked out pretty much OK, didn't they?
NOT DONE YET!
Wow, coins!
It's raining coins!
Coins!
Zis is wonderful!
Zis is excellent!
Zis is zee ultimate tourist attraction!
Oui! Zee golden island of endless coins for all!
Zis is a catchphrase, non? It has zee ring to it!
Um... Excuse me... Prince Dreambert...
Prince Dreambert?
Oh, I beg your pardon... My mind was reeling...
Thank you for all you've done for us!
I believe the Pi'illo Kingdom can be revived now!
It can.
...But this overreliance on the Dream Stone...
The Zeekeeper has the right of it, I deem.
Hereafter, we shall unite our forces to restore the kingdom ourselves!
Mario.
And Luigi.
We owe you our deepest thanks. All is once again normal!
The Pi'illo folk... The Pi'illo Kingdom...
Not the Dream Stone, though...
Come on, let it go!
Everyone, thank you! Thank you so much!
Please be at one with the ultimate vacation!
Enjoy Pi'illo Island!
Of course!
Our true vacation starts right NOW!
Mario! Luigi! Let's go!
So this is my new pad, huh?
GWAHAHAHA!
I like it!
This Dream Stone ain't too shabby!
SCREEETCH! You like it, yesss...
Yes, I like it. You don't have to screech at me. Anyway, it's PERFECT for world conquering!
And I will name it Neo Bowser Castle!
Neo Bowser Castle...
SCREEPTH! You may call it however you like, of course...
But let us take it for a test drive...
Yesss... Let us try it out... SCREEK!
Whoa. WHOA.
The islands... Gone.
That...is scary.
YES! AWESOME!
This thing is NASTY! With this castle, we can do whatever we want!
SCREEHEE!
You are next in line, honorable Bowser...
It is time you vished for yourself... SCREECH!
Can do, buddy! GWAHAHAHA!
I'll give you the full tour first.
Remember: This ain't a playground. It's a construction zone.
You need some job trainin' before I let you use this thing.
STOP!
Let's turn this thing around.
You gotta hit that thing there with the drill.
And that's how you change directions.
You really gotta pay attention when you're using this thing.
You look down at your phone, and BAM! It's game over, bub.
STOP!
You know the drill. Turn this thing around.
Not bad.
But it'll be harder when this thing is movin'.
You gotta work on your timin'.
ACK!
Scree...hee hee!
OW!
Yes... Yes! YESSS!
HRRP!
Hey, ugly! Learn to fly!
FREEE! SCREEK!
I RETURN!
Ooh, look who made a powerful buddy!
That's right, me! Now I'm unstoppable!
GWAHAHA!
B-Bowser? And that bat...
I mean, that was... Bowser, right?
Princess Peach!
Oh, thank goodness!
It seems our travel went well, correct?
Looks like all are safe and sound!
I'm sorry for making everyone worry. I'm fine, thank you!
Mario... Thank you!
We'd better tell Toadsworth, too!
My friends, we haven't the time for niceties!
Evil is upon us! Antasma...
Antasma has returned!
Im-impossible! My prince... Are you absolutely sure?
Antasma?!
The very same. He who we imprisoned in the dream world.
The evil king of bats...
He has returned to plague us once more!
Not only that, but he's teamed up with Bowser!
He will again try to conquer our world and sow the nightmare!
Hmmm...
If that's the case, Antasma will surely go after the Dream Stone!
The Dream Stone...
It can grant any wish... and it's on this island, right?
We must leave this area and make for the nearby desert...
The stone is in Dozing Sands!
Mario!
Luigi!
Please, I beg of you... Stop Antasma and Bowser!
If two such evil beings were to get the Dream Stone...
The world would be in utter peril!
Whatever it takes, you have to prevent that from happening...
Please! It's up to you to stop Antasma and Bowser!
EEEEEEEK!
NOOOOOO!!
AIYEEEE!
NOT THE FACE!
The Dream Stone has been restored...
Now vee begin to conquer the vorld... SCREEPLE!
Solid! Let's do it!
Where to begin, though... Hm...
THINK, MINIONS!
Oh! Right, boss... Errrmmm...
How about we steal the world's food? And then EAT it.
Sir, four simple words: fan club with rewards!
You fools! Be more smart!
SCREEET!
I haff already thought of a thing vee vill need...
Really?! What?!
A CASTLE!
To conquer the vorld, vee vill need a castle...
Mm. A castle, huh? Good point.
Yeah... Castle...
So we create a base on the island and conquer the world from that?
Genius!
We'll build the best castle on the whole island! Yeah!
A new castle... For just us...
It vill be strong... Castle... Castle...
BUILD IT! SCREE!
GAAAH!
Can't this tub fly faster?!
Your Surliness...
Let's take our lumps and lay low for a bit, please...
Are you nuts?!
This isn't on me, bub! I was a total champ!
That Antasma guy just stunk it up!
And you guys...
Well, no... Actually, you minions did pretty well by your usual standards...
King... King Bowser...
Thank you, sir!
I... I'm gonna crash. These tears of joy...
Hear this! I will kidnap Peach OVER and OVER until I pull it off! And no one can stop me!
Losing is not an option! And neither is giving up!
That's why you're the boss, boss!
Sir, permission to call you the coolest!
I would follow you into a BOTTOMLESS PIT!
I'LL BE BACK!
MARIO! GREEN STA—!
I MEAN, LUIGI!
Whoa, coins!
Coins!
You idiots! Stop jostling!
SCREEHEEEECH!
SCREEP!
SCREEEEBTH!
Yessss! We did it!
We defeated Antasma!
Yes, at last... We win at last!
Mario... Luigi... You have my thanks!
Now, we must focus! We must finish Bowser!
Easy, Dreambert! Don't push yourself!
It is all right. I am well.
Mario. Luigi. Onward!
Mario! Luigi! Now it's DEFINITELY the final battle!
Bowser and his minions are atop the castle.
We must focus our power and pursue!
