Care to try it again?
Oh? You're OK on your own?
Oh? You're OK on your own?
Oh? You're OK on your own?
Here comes enlightenment!
Here comes enlightenment!

I understand. Best of luck, Dreamy Luigi!

??????????
Allow me to teach you how one battles in giant form.
First, jumping.
Shall I teach you how to perform the jump attack?
Touch the Jump icon.
Once you're in a ready crouch, an arrow will appear.
Slide in the arrow's direction, and you will jump, but...
Do not slide right away! Await the charged-up sign!
Now slide upward to jump!
Now is your time! Your arms spread! Light shines forth!
Slide upward again to leap ever higher!
Stomp after charging and the arrow appears again!
It's vital that you wait for the charged-up sign!
Now your foe attacks... Jump to avoid its barrage!
Look! A tornado lingers in the dreamy distance!
Shall I teach you how one performs a hammer attack?
A hammer attack will hurl the foe into its windy maw!
Touch the Hammer icon.
Next, you must touch the Hammer Chop icon.
As you take your hammering stance, an arrow will appear.
Slide quickly in the arrow's direction!
Slide quickly to the left to swing the hammer sideways.
Slide quickly to the right to swing the hammer sideways.
Hammer Chops always hit foes into the background!
Counter with the hammer!
You OK, Dreamy Luigi?!
Your HP has fallen!
You must work with Mario to restore your HP!
Touch the Bros. Attack icon.
Then you must touch the Rhythm Mushroom icon.
Mario will throw Mushrooms rhythmically. Be at one with the rhythm!
Tap the screen with the same rhythm to eat the Mushrooms!
You must give it a try! Forward!
Tap the screen in rhythm to eat the Mushrooms!
One thing slipped my mind...
Bros. Attacks cannot be used consecutively.
Ah yes, Mario must rest a bit after he uses his power.
That should be enough for you to fell this foe!
Dreamy Luigi! Mario! Be at one with victory!
It is time! The foe is weak and ripe for defeat!
Finish it off with the Finishing Bros.!
Now touch the Finishing Bros. icon.
Tilt the Nintendo 3DS to set the marker on the foe!
YOU DARE CHALLENGE ME?!
That should even things!
Use the hammer this time!
That looks...impenetrable.
If only there was a way to break his guard...
GRAWWWR!
Ah! Why not try the Hammer Uppercut?
I'm well trained in Hammer Uppercuts. Shall I teach you?
Touch the Hammer icon.
Now you must touch the Hammer Uppercut icon.
Slide quickly in the arrow's direction to swing the hammer vertically!
Quickly slide upward to swing the hammer vertically.
That Hammer Uppercut launched the foe backward!
Now for it, Dreamy Luigi! He sprawls defenseless!
Work with Mario and unleash a Bros. Attack!
Touch the Bros. Attack icon.
Now touch the Drill Stomp icon.
Make circles in the arrow's direction to make Mario spin faster!
If you make lots of circles, the arrow will appear again. Then make more circles!
Now spin in the other direction! Be ever mindful!
When the Drill Stomp ends, Mario will flag and need rest, as with Rhythm Mushroom.
You won't be able to use Bros. Attacks for a bit, so make use of them wisely!
NOW I'MA GET SUPERHEATED!
I have a plan! Drive it into the sea, and then attack it!
Dreamy Luigi! Focus! Don't wig out!
Be at one with defeating this giant...town...monster.
Good! Keep up this pace to drop it into the sea!
That attack doesn't appear to be very effective.
Success! When it emerges, bonk it over and over!
So much armor! You won't be able to move it at all!
And it would take too long to destroy it piecemeal...
But perhaps a strong enough attack would break all of it!
Ah. Armor. Looks heavy! Budging it will be tough...
If only you could break it...
EARTH-A-WAKE!
BAD-DAMAGE! DAMAGE-BAD!
BAD-STACHES! MUST DEFEAT!
Use that move to finish it! You know! THAT move!
Pick the right time to jump out of there safely!
You are brave, little one.
And nimble. But your luck shall not last. Abandon hope.
You would fight me?
Very well, then... Marshal your power and...
Try to stop me!
Chase the Zeekeeper!
It seems as though I have underestimated you...
But neither have I unveiled my true strength!
I can offer you no mercy. I am sorry. It must be so!
Impressive. Yes, very.
You've almost got it! Just hang in there!
Did I not warn you? You are no match for me!
Now! Grab it!
None may hinder me! I shall remain aloft!
The Zeekeeper... Who knew it could cross dimensions?!
We must match its power!
Dreamy Luigi! Stay on the Zeekeeper's tail!
It's about to unleash an attack... I sense this.
You must dodge and then counter by ramming into it!
You are persistent...
Phew... Slight weariness overcomes me...
The Zeekeeper seems to be slowing a bit!
Catch up with it, and drag it down to earth!
Keep at it! ATTAAAACK!
You have great strength... I concede you are powerful...
But so, too, am I! The battle is not over yet!
SCRAAW!
OK, it's finishing time, Dreamy Luigi!
Twice you have forced me to tear a dimensional rift...
You are a worthy foe! But now I must end this.
Transforming into a giant... I invented that, pal!
No way some green stache gets to bite MY style!
Bowser, sire! Your loyal minions stand at the ready!
You must defeat Bowser! Save this good world!
Ah, time for my dream to finally come true!
SHOWTIME!
GWAHAHAHA! Nowhere to run!
Remember all you've learned! AND WIN THIS DAY!
The floor seems unstable...
How DARE you?!
Time to say night-night!
Fight back in kind, Dreamy Luigi!
Dreamy Luigi! Mario!
The final Finishing Bros. will pay for all!
Ohhh, sire... Bowser... How could this happen...
And yet... There is still hope.
With my last spell, I will give you tremendous power...
Minions, rise for Bowser! GIVE HIM YOUR POWER!
YEEAAAAHH!
Huh?!
Uh-oh.
Yes! He's all woozy! It's our chance to attack!
I'll help too!
HEEEYAAAAAH!
Let's do this!
Shall I make the Star Driver a bit...easier?
Grrrrrrr... You pests...
Take THIS!
Haaff... Hefff...
This...is far from over!
GAAHAAHAA! I FEEL GREAT!
FINISHING YOU WILL BE CAKE!
Dreamy Luigi! Beware! Behind you!
Quiet, you little fluffball! Enough with the chatting!
Huh?! Whah?! Nowhere to go!
THERE!
AIN'T OVER YET, CHUMPS!
Cornered again!
THAT'S where I'll finish you!
Don't rush! Careful!
No more turns! The battle must end!
Slide round and round in the arrow's direction.
Slide round and round even more in the arrow's direction.
The arrow may point in a new direction. Spin carefully!
