My! What a mighty leap!\wait

Well done,\\
Master Mario!\wait

Of course, if you press the button\\

You'll deliver even more damage! I\\
beg of you, have a go at it!\wait

As you clearly know, pressing the\\
button again on your second leap...\wait \pagebreak
It delivers even more damage! I trust\\
you'll keep this front of mind?\wait

When you jump...\wait 

\string


\string
As you just saw, your foes\\
will close in and attack!\wait

However... You can\\
dodge such things!\wait

Master Mario! A\\

And you earn\color[44,101,255,255] EXP\color[0,0,0,255]!\\
Yes, experience points!\wait 

\string
For this bout, you\\
got \color[44,101,255,255]3\color[0,0,0,255] EXP!\wait

you earn EXP!\wait \pagebreak
For what you just earned,\\

When you level up...\wait

Your stats go up and\\

Oh, wow! Congratulations!\\
Your\color[44,101,255,255] rank\color[0,0,0,255] went up!\wait

As you grow even stronger,\\
you'll continue to gain ranks!\wait 

\string
Furthermore\code[3,0,10], something GREAT\\
happens when you rank up!\wait 

\string
Uh-huh... Each time your rank\\
goes up...\wait \pagebreak
You get a\color[44,101,255,255] bonus\color[0,0,0,255] that'll be very\\
useful during your battles!\wait 

\string
There are various bonuses!\code[3,0,10]\\
For example...\wait 

\string
This increases the number\\
of items you can equip!\wait 

\string
There are many other\\
types of bonuses!\wait \pagebreak
Choose the one that\\
fits you the best!\wait 

\string
Ah! \code[3,0,10]I forgot\\
one thing!\wait 

\string
There's a limit to the number of\\
times your rank can go up.\wait \pagebreak
So... You won't ever get ALL of\\
the available bonuses!\wait

Think long and hard before\\
you choose a bonus!\wait

\space[8]\option \space[1]Yes\code[3,0,10]

OK, gotcha!\wait

First, choose\color[44,101,255,255] Bros. Attack\color[0,0,0,255]\\
from the command blocks!\wait 

\string
Choose the Bros. Attack\\
you'd like to use here.\wait 

\string
\color[44,101,255,255]3D Red Shell\color[0,0,0,255] is the only one\\
you can choose right now.\wait 

\string
For this attack, Mario and Luigi\\
will take turns kicking the shell!\wait 

\string
Please check here if you need\\
a more detailed explanation!\wait 

\string
Give it a try\\
right now!\wait 

\string
Press the button to start\\
it once you're ready!

\string
\code[7,0]\size[150]STOP!\code[3,0,10]\wait \size[100]

Luigi can kick back the\\

It's Mario's turn now! Kick it\\
back with the \color[255,51,51,255]A\color[0,0,0,255] Button!

\string
Hit the enemy multiple times by\\
continuously kicking the shell!\wait 

\string
But if you don't time your kick right,\\
you'll trip and fail. Keep that in mind!\wait 

\string


\string
Also, you'll need\color[44,101,255,255] BP\color[0,0,0,255] to\\
use any Bros. Attack!\wait 

\string
BP are Bros. Points...\wait 

\string
They're the number right\\
next to the shell, OK?\wait 

\string
This is the amount of BP\\
that'll get used each time!\wait 

\string
Without enough BP, you\\
can't use Bros. Attacks!\wait 

\string
You can use\color[44,101,255,255] Syrup Jars\color[0,0,0,255]\\
to restore your BP!\wait 

\string
Also,\code[3,0,10] Bros. Attacks require\\
you two to work together...\wait 

\string
So if either of you can't fight,\\
you can't use these attacks!\wait 

\string
OK! Let's wrap\\

\string
In the\color[44,101,255,255] third\color[0,0,0,255] battle with\color[44,101,255,255] Kamek\color[0,0,0,255],\\
each of the \color[44,101,255,255]4 Kamek copies\color[0,0,0,255] has\\
a different role! The\color[44,101,255,255] green one\color[0,0,0,255]\\
boosts the group's stats, so\\
defeat that one first!

\string
Remember the Shapes

\string
The ○△□▽ spells from\color[44,101,255,255] Kamek's\color[0,0,0,255]\\
magic move in specific directions\\
depending on their shape. ○:\\
Comes from the front. □: Comes\\
from the rear. △: Comes from\\
the right. ▽: Comes from the\\
left. Be careful! It's tricky to\\
distinguish △ from ▽! Keep in\\
mind that the enemy's\color[44,101,255,255] SPEED\color[0,0,0,255]\\
stat gets faster with the\color[44,101,255,255] green\\
Kamek copy's\color[0,0,0,255] magic!

\string
Giant-Broom Service

\string
Focus on the giant broom's moves\\
to foresee its attack! When it\\
sweeps on the same spot, that's\\
its\color[44,101,255,255] tell\color[0,0,0,255]! It's going to attack\color[255,51,51,255]\\
Mario\color[0,0,0,255]! Slide the\color[44,101,255,255] Circle Pad\color[0,0,0,255] at\\
the right time to escape from the\\
broom's trajectory.

\string
Escape the Nightmare

\string
If you get hit by\color[44,101,255,255] Antasma\color[0,0,0,255] and\\
fall asleep, you'll be caught in an\\
endless nightmare. Jump out through\\
the exit hole, or remain trapped\\
forever! There is only\color[44,101,255,255] one\color[0,0,0,255] exit.\\
All other holes are decoys. Jump\\
through a hole to discover its\\
nature. Find the exit—hurry!

\string
Get In the Ring!

\string
When\color[44,101,255,255] Antasma\color[0,0,0,255] throws a ring, make\\
sure you get inside it. If you stay\\
outside of the ring, you'll always get\\
hit by the shock wave...and that'll\\
hurt badly! When\color[44,101,255,255] Antasma\color[0,0,0,255] raises\\
his hand, the direction where the ring\\
falls will change, so move toward the\\
side where he raised his hand. It's\\
easier if you stay in the middle to\\
prepare yourself!

\string
Inside the Ring

\string
Once you're in the ring, look at\color[44,101,255,255]\\
Antasma\color[0,0,0,255] again! When\color[44,101,255,255] Antasma\color[0,0,0,255]\\
drops both hands, the ring will\\
shrink shortly thereafter. Wait a\\
bit to jump and dodge it!

\string
Wake Up, Sleepyhead!

\string
After\color[44,101,255,255] Antasma\color[0,0,0,255] goes to sleep, he'll\\
start steadily regaining\color[44,101,255,255] HP\color[0,0,0,255]. When\\
sleeping,\color[44,101,255,255] Antasma\color[0,0,0,255] is impervious to\\
all attacks. Wake up\color[44,101,255,255] Antasma\color[0,0,0,255] by\\
destroying all of the\color[44,101,255,255] Antasmunchies\color[0,0,0,255]\\
ASAP! You can defeat\color[44,101,255,255]\\
Antasmunchies\color[0,0,0,255] en masse with\color[44,101,255,255]\\
Luiginary Attacks\color[0,0,0,255]!

\string
Bye, Dreamy Bowser!

\string
\color[44,101,255,255]Dreamy Bowser\color[0,0,0,255] will block attacks\\
to his body with his\color[44,101,255,255] right arm\color[0,0,0,255].\\
Defeat the\color[44,101,255,255] right arm\color[0,0,0,255] first to be\\
able to damage his body. If\color[255,51,51,255] Mario\color[0,0,0,255]\\
or\color[14,173,67,255] Luigi\color[0,0,0,255] gets caught, attack the\color[44,101,255,255]\\
left arm\color[0,0,0,255] to free him.

\string
Minion Mop-Up

\string
If the\color[44,101,255,255] Koopa Corps\color[0,0,0,255] show up, aim\\
for\color[44,101,255,255] Dreamy Bob-ombs\color[0,0,0,255] first. When\\
you defeat one, it'll explode,\\
damaging nearby enemies! Use \color[44,101,255,255]a\\
Taunt Ball\color[0,0,0,255] to enrage\color[44,101,255,255] Dreamy\\
Bowser\color[0,0,0,255] and make him attack you.\\
Deal damage to the\color[44,101,255,255] Koopa\color[44,101,255,255] Corps\color[44,101,255,255]\color[0,0,0,255]\\
en masse!

\string
Taunt Balls Ahoy

Counter Offensive

\string
The\color[44,101,255,255] Gold Beanie\color[0,0,0,255] often flees. But\\
hit it with a counterattack, and\\
the\color[44,101,255,255] Gold Beanie\color[0,0,0,255] won't be able to\\
flee on its next turn!

\string
Gold Beanie's Tell

\string
Watch the\color[44,101,255,255] Gold Beanie\color[0,0,0,255] after\\
countering its running attack. If it\\
stumbles on its way back, it'll jump\\
for its next attack! The timing of\\
when it hits\color[255,51,51,255] Mario\color[0,0,0,255] will be slightly\\
late, so wait a beat before\\
swinging the hammer!

\string
Creeping Beanie

\string
Be extra careful if the\color[44,101,255,255] Gold\\
Beani\color[0,0,0,255]e calls a crowd of buddies!\\
It'll hide behind its buddies to sneak\\
up on\color[255,51,51,255] Mario\color[0,0,0,255]. Stomp on the enemies\\
concealing th\color[44,101,255,255]e Gold Beanie\color[0,0,0,255] to\\
counter! While the\color[44,101,255,255] Gold Beanie\color[0,0,0,255] is\\
hiding, it'll keep changing its position,\\
so keep an eye on it!

\string

won't be able to attack for a\\
while but you won't take any\\
damage either! Use those moments\\
of peace to observe enemy\\
attacks and plan your defense!

\string
Slow and Steady
