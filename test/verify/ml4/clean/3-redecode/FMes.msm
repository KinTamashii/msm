I don't think those feathers\\
will be going anywhere soon.\wait \pagebreak
But then again, neither am I!\wait

Even that earthquake didn't\\
knock the feathers off!\wait \pagebreak
They must have really stuck\\
them on there hard...\wait 

\string
What's wrong? Hurry up\\
and take the picture!\wait

I want both feathers\\
aligned in the picture.\wait \pagebreak
But getting the timing\\
right is kind of hard.\wait

Ughh... Staring at those\\
feathers is making me dizzy.\wait

Gah! I can't see anything!\\

\code[1,4]This WOULD be a\\
relaxing park...\wait \pagebreak
If it weren't for\\
all the monsters!\wait \pagebreak
I guess variety is\\
good though.\wait \pagebreak
Gotta keep us on\\
our toes.\wait 

\string
They blocked the road\\
over there earlier.\wait \pagebreak
But I heard there are\\
cool attractions there!\wait \pagebreak
They have Slingshrooms\\

\string
When that castle started\\
floating, I ran to the blimport.\wait \pagebreak
All the flights were booked\\
solid though, so I came back.\wait \pagebreak
I guess everyone is trying to\\
get off the island.\wait 

\string
The castle should be the last\\
of the craziness though, right?\wait 

\string
Floating castles and\\
mega earthquakes?!\wait \pagebreak
Sigh. I guess I might as\\
well embrace it.\wait \pagebreak
I'm going to have some\\
wild vacation memories!\wait 

\string
The prettiest spot in the\\
park is just ahead!\wait \pagebreak
There's a huge fountain\\
and gorgeous flowers.\wait \pagebreak
It's really incredible. I'm\\
so glad I came!\wait

Did you see the fountain and\\
flowers? So breathtaking!\wait \pagebreak
I think I'll extend my vacation so\\
I can stare at them more!\wait

Have you seen it?\\
You must have.\wait \pagebreak
That creepy castle\\
in the sky?\wait \pagebreak
It sends a shiver\\
up my spine!\wait 

\string
Maybe I should end\\
my vacation early...\wait 

\string
OHHHH! What\\
a tragedy!\wait \pagebreak
The fountain.\\
IT'S RUINED!\wait \pagebreak
It's all that\\
castle's fault!\wait 

\string
Hoo know, Mushrise Park was\\
once just a muddy field.\wait \pagebreak
But then that Bricky guy\\
transformed it into hoo.\wait \pagebreak
Amazing what a little elbow\\

Really gotta hoo me some\\

We've had a lot of visitors\\

Even Princess Peach is\\

Princess Peach might\\

I better make sure\\

I'm her biggest fan!\\
AHHHHHHHHHHHH!\wait

Right here! Princess Peach\\
walked right through here!\wait \pagebreak
I'm going to call this Princess\\
Peach Path from now on!\wait 

\string
Mr. Brickle told us to just\\
ignore the floating castle.\wait \pagebreak
How do you "just ignore" a\\
floating castle, HUH?!\wait \pagebreak
I think he doesn't want us\\
to scare the visitors away.\wait

Am I crazy? With the\\
whole castle business?\wait \pagebreak
The more time passes, the\\
more unreal it all seems.\wait

Sorry, folks! This gate\\
is out of service.\wait \pagebreak
There are too many\\
monsters on the loose.\wait \pagebreak
Boss Brickle gave me\\
strict lockdown orders.\wait \pagebreak
Please exit via the\\

You'll meet a legendary\\

Now that's my idea of a\\
good time!\wait

I see you've been walking\\
around the Dozing Sands.\wait \pagebreak
How'd I know that? Your\\
boots have sand on them!\wait 

\string
All right, then. Have\\
a nice trip!\wait 

\string
I hear everyone's trying to\\
leave the island.\wait \pagebreak
I don't blame them. That\\
flying castle is terrifying!\wait 

\string
Maybe that earthquake\\
was a good thing.\wait \pagebreak
Maybe it means all the\\
monsters left the island.\wait \pagebreak
Maybe I'm in denial...\wait 

\string
Storm knocked a tree\\
across the path.\wait \pagebreak
But fear not! The park\\
staff are on it!\wait

Do it, boys!\\
WOO! WOO!\wait

Our apologies, folks!\\

OK. Princess Peach, I think it'll be\\

Mario, Luigi... Good luck.\\
I'll leave this to you.\wait

We should be going too!\wait

Hold a moment!\code[3,0,40]

Eldream? Is\\
anything amiss?\wait 

\string
Oh no, there is no\\
crisis, my prince.\wait 

\string
I just wanted to tell my fellow\\

\string
If you stand true and bring\\
more aid to the Pi'illo folk...\wait \pagebreak
I hope you will come see me\\
on occasion.\wait 

\string
As a Pi'illo elder, I have gifts I\\
would bequeath to those worthy.\wait 

\string
Well spoken, Eldream! You\\
do our people proud!\wait 

\string
Eldream speaks truly, and know that I\\
will add some gifts of my own!\wait \pagebreak
As you travel, I hope you will continue\\
to help any Pi'illo folk you find.\wait \pagebreak
You have such strength within you!\\
Use it to help the sleeping stones!\wait 

\string
Yes, well, THIS Pi'illo is going to have\\
a nice nap in the administrator's hut.\wait

Oh, I forgot! So far, you've\\
helped a total of \color[44,101,255,255] \option \color[0,0,0,255] Pi'illos!\wait \pagebreak

The\color[44,101,255,255] Dozing Sands\color[0,0,0,255] are\\

The bad guys might have\\

If you have any questions\\
about things in the park...\wait \pagebreak
I'd find the park curator,\\
Boss Brickle!\wait \pagebreak
He's probably up north, by\\
the former fountain.\wait

\string
Hmm...\code[3,0,40]

\string
We moved the tree that\\
was blocking this path.\wait

But now there are a bunch\\

We really need to get rid\\
of all those rocks though...\wait

Ah, dear guest!\\
May I help you?\wait

Ready, guys?\\
Quiet please.\wait

Pi'illo Island's climate makes\\

Can anyone guess\\
how it works?\wait 

\string
I have no idea!\code[3,0,20]

\string
Tell us!\code[3,0,20]

\string
Well...\wait 

\string
First, we dug a long tunnel with\\
access from that drainpipe.\wait \pagebreak
We set up a pipe system fed by\\
an underground reservoir.\wait \pagebreak
Finally, an\color[44,101,255,255] underground\color[0,0,0,255]\color[44,101,255,255] pump\color[0,0,0,255] to\\

Boss Brickle!\wait

Whoa!\code[3,0,20]

This Boss Brickle must be\\
some kind of genius!\wait

Amazing!\\
Oh, but...\wait 

\string
Who is this Boss Brickle?\wait 

\string
Aww! It's broken!\wait 

\string
That explosion earlier\\
must have ruined it...\wait 

\string
Fresh water sources are rare\\
here because of the climate.\wait \pagebreak
So we installed an efficient\\
new system for the fountain!\wait 

\string
We use long pipes to pull\\
water from a reservoir.\wait \pagebreak
Then, an\color[44,101,255,255] underground\color[0,0,0,255]\color[44,101,255,255] pump\color[0,0,0,255]\\

the end of the tour!\wait

Can anyone name this plant\\
found all around the park?\wait \pagebreak
These are Thick Mushrooms!\wait

Really? These\\
are mushrooms?\wait

We don't have mushrooms\\
like this back home!\wait

Apparently, Pi'illo Blimport is\\

Sure, the castle in the sky is\\
slightly terrifying, but...\wait

AHHH! The flying castle of\\
doom is gonna eat me!\wait

Attention, guests! It's all\\
under control.\wait \pagebreak
Please enjoy your stay\\
here in Mushrise Park!\wait

That castle is still hovering\\
there...staring into my soul.\wait \pagebreak
My boss was right. Going on\\
vacation was a terrible idea.\wait

The people in that castle\\
could be watching us.\wait \pagebreak
There's something really\\
creepy about that...\wait 

\string
Everything is under control!\\
That earthquake earlier...\wait \pagebreak
Was just a monster-filled castle\\
crashing to the ground!\wait

The flying monster castle\\
crashed into the ground?!\wait \pagebreak
What's going to happen\\
next on this crazy island?\wait

At least that evil castle\\
is on the ground now.\wait \pagebreak
Never thought I'd say\\
THAT on my vacation.\wait

\string
Oh please...\wait 

\string
There's a killer castle in the\\
sky! We're all goners!\wait \pagebreak
Evacuate! We have to panic\\
and evacuate!\wait 

\string
That castle has got to be\\
some kind of marketing ploy.\wait 

\string
These marketing types\\
are getting desperate.\wait 

\string
Well, the castle hasn't\\
vaporized us yet... \wait \pagebreak
So maybe it's friendly?\\
Enjoy your stay!\wait

Ooh! I hope the castle\\
explodes into fireworks!\wait

You guys really know how\\
to put on a show!\wait

Errrrr...\code[3,0,15] Well... We didn't\\

before but on a\color[44,101,255,255] hard surface\color[0,0,0,255].\wait

better give this a second hoo...\wait

Guy's a great tour guide!\\

Humph! Yes, well, Princess Peach\\

\code[1,4]Also, see that icon in the\\

\string
\code[1,4]Like that! Check out your \color[255,51,51,255]A\color[0,0,0,255] Button now!\wait \pagebreak

That was a LOT of visitors...\wait 

\string
\code[1,4]You felt that big quake, right?\wait \pagebreak
I heard it was an impact tremor from that\\
floating sky castle plunging to earth.\wait \pagebreak
That castle has PROBLEMS.\wait 

\string
\code[1,4]Well, guess I'd better get\\
started on the maintenance.\wait 

\string
\code[1,4]Right bay, OK!\code[3,0,10] Left bay, OK!\wait \pagebreak
All systems normal!\wait 

\string
\code[1,4]I got besieged by requests to\\
pilot the airship...so I did.\wait \pagebreak
But then I'm like, hello? There's a\\
giant castle floating in the air.\wait \pagebreak
They don't teach that stuff in\\
blimp school, trust me.\wait 

\string
\code[1,4]So, word is that some mysterious hovering\\
castle crash-landed.\wait \pagebreak
Good. Now we can fly the blimps without\\
worrying about hitting a FLYING BUILDING.\wait 

\string
\code[1,4]Nice!\wait \pagebreak
Always good to see the\\

\code[1,4]No way!\wait

\code[1,4]Mmmm... Zis is not so crazy, non.\\
During zee Pi'illo Kingdom era...\wait \pagebreak

have that power...\wait 

\string
\code[1,4]Perhaps it's not Luigi? What if it's\\
the rock that's beneath his head?\wait \pagebreak
Do you think that thing might be\\
responsible for this phenomenon?\wait

Afternoon, Mr. Mario!\\
Hey, Mr. Luigi!\wait \pagebreak
Past here, you'll see the\\
clock-tower plaza.\wait \pagebreak
It's super popular... though\\
I can't see why.\wait 

\string
Y'know, me and this guy got\\
to chatting and became pals!\wait \pagebreak
When that castle showed up,\\
we took off together.\wait \pagebreak
I guess that's how you make\\
a traveling buddy, huh?\wait 

\string
The clock tower over there is\\
the worst tourist attraction...\wait \pagebreak
Wanna know what it's called?\\
"Ordinary Clock Tower."\wait \pagebreak
And yup, that's what it is!\\
Talk about weak...\wait 

\string
Before we left the Mushroom\\
Kingdom to come to this island...\wait \pagebreak
I never thought I'd live to see\\
something so scary!\wait \pagebreak
Well, I guess scary things happen\\
back home, but still...\wait 

\string
Y'know how you just KNOW a\\
spot is going to disappoint you...\wait \pagebreak
But you get excited wondering\\
HOW disappointing it'll be?\wait 

\string
As you can see, we're all\\
doing just fine.\wait \pagebreak
I wonder if Princess Peach\\
is safe...\wait \pagebreak
Well, you guys are on the\\
job, so she'll be OK!\wait 

\string
We need to run away!\\
Quick, to the blimport!\wait 

\string
Calm down! Just chill!\\
Everything will be fine!\wait 

\string
Stay calm? STAY CALM?!\\
Three islands just vanished!\wait 

\string
Well, these two heroes are\\
on THIS island, right?\wait \pagebreak
You just know they're gonna\\
deal with that castle, dude!\wait 

\string
Hey, that's true! Why do I\\
always panic?!\wait \pagebreak
\code[1,1]\code[1,4]I never learn!\wait

Take care of business,\\
Mr. Mario!\wait

Good luck,\\
Mr. Luigi!\wait

You probably know lots of\\
Pi'illo ruins are on this island.\wait \pagebreak
Yeah, while a lot of this place\\
is developed for visitors...\wait \pagebreak
Somnom Woods is basically\\
untouched by tourism.\wait \pagebreak
I bet the forest is amazingly\\
mystical and spooky!\wait 

\string
That castle's beam vaporized\\
three of the barrier islands!\wait \pagebreak
There were ruins and rare\\
plants there... Now all gone.\wait

Hello! Need any directions for\\

Hope that helps!\wait

I didn't know WHAT to do\\
when that castle appeared.\wait \pagebreak
Mr. Toad here helped me stay\\
cool and evacuate!\wait \pagebreak
What a great guy... I would\\
have totally lost it otherwise.\wait 

\string
They say this wall was erected\\
by Pi'illos in ancient times.\wait \pagebreak
I love the way they left the\\
ruins intact in this town...\wait \pagebreak

buildings... Brilliant move!\wait

Wait... The wall is gone!\wait

It is rare, but sometimes they\\

\string
Those who suffer such a\\

\string
We have no choice!\\
We must wake him...\wait 

\string
\size[150]\code[1,4]\code[1,1]IN his dream!\wait \size[100]

\string
First, we must find him\\
in the dream world.\wait \pagebreak
Then we must convince\\
him to wake!\wait 

\string
So we'll need to go inside\\
Big Massif's dream?!\wait \pagebreak
Is that even possible?\\
Someone else's dream?\wait 

\string
It is. Luigi, please try\\
sleeping next to him.\wait 

\string
If two sleep near one another\\
on a Dreampoint...\wait \pagebreak
It is possible for two people\\
to have the same dream!\wait 

\string
Perfect! That'll get us into\\
Big Massif's dream world!\wait 

\string
Very well, Luigi! Lay\\
your head on me!\wait
