\string
This is the menu screen.\wait 

\string
Come here to use the items\\
that you guys have picked up...\wait 

\string
Or change gear...\wait 

\string
Or do a little research\\
on yourselves.\wait 

\string
So the top screen shows\\
your present location and\\
how many coins you have...\wait \pagebreak
Oh! And also how much\\
time you've spent playing.\wait 

\string
There's just a ton of useful info\\
buried in the menu screen.\wait \pagebreak
You definitely ought to pop in\\
now and then to check it out.\wait 

\string
Anyway, let's try\\
using a\color[44,101,255,255] Mushroom\color[0,0,0,255]!\wait 

\string
When you want to use something\\
you're carrying, choose Items.\wait 

\string
Use the\color[44,101,255,255] +Control Pad\color[0,0,0,255] to go to\\
Items, and then press the \color[44,101,255,255]A\color[0,0,0,255] Button.\wait \pagebreak
You can also just\color[44,101,255,255] tap\color[0,0,0,255] the Items\\
icon. Nice, huh?\wait 

\string
Give it a try!\wait 

\string
OK, so these are the items\\
currently in your inventory.\wait 

\string
What we want to do is select\\
Mushrooms from the list.\wait 

\string
Use the\color[44,101,255,255] +Control Pad\color[0,0,0,255] to highlight\\
Mushrooms, then press the \color[44,101,255,255]A\color[0,0,0,255] Button.\wait \pagebreak
You can also just\color[44,101,255,255] tap\color[0,0,0,255] Mushrooms, of\\
course.\wait 

\string
Once you've selected the item\\
you want to use, you need to\\
choose who will use it.\wait 

\string
For this time,\\
select Luigi.\wait 

\string
Use the\color[44,101,255,255] +Control Pad\color[0,0,0,255] to pick\\
Luigi, then press the \color[44,101,255,255]A\color[0,0,0,255] Button.\wait \pagebreak
You can also just\color[44,101,255,255] tap\color[0,0,0,255] the Luigi\\
panel if you like.\wait 

\string
All right!\\
He's healed!\wait 

\string
OK, let's head back\\

the Badges icon.\wait 

\string
This is where you can check out all\\
the badges you guys have collected!\wait \pagebreak
You can each wield one badge at\\
any given time.\wait 

\string
Next time you get a new\\
badge, be sure to look at\\
it in the Badges menu!\wait 

\string
OK, close the menu.\wait 

\string
\code[1,4]By the way, th\color[44,101,255,255]e B\color[0,0,0,255] Button isn't\\
the only way to close menus.\wait \pagebreak
If you press\color[44,101,255,255] START\color[0,0,0,255], you can\\
close any open menu with a\\
\space[1]single touch.\wait 

\string


\string
All right, this'll be quick!\wait 

\string
When you want to view your\color[44,101,255,255]\\
Attack Pieces\color[0,0,0,255], select Guide.\wait 

\string
Go on and select Guide.\wait 

\string
In here, you can review any battle\\
tutorials you've seen so far.\wait 

\string

summary of your adventure so far.\wait

you've found, select Attacks.\wait 

\string
Go ahead! Select Attacks.\wait 

\string

\string
When you get a new\color[44,101,255,255] Attack Piece\color[0,0,0,255],\\
you may want to check it out in the\\
Attacks section of the Guide, OK?\wait 

\string
All right, close the menu.\wait 

\string


\string
Let me explain how to view the\color[44,101,255,255]\\
Bros. Attack\color[0,0,0,255] you just learned.\wait \pagebreak
You can check\color[44,101,255,255] Attacks\color[0,0,0,255]\color[44,101,255,255]\color[0,0,0,255] basically\\
like you did Attack Pieces.\wait 

\string
First, go ahead and select Guide.\wait 

\string
C'mon, select Guide.\wait 

\string
OK, now select Attacks.\wait 

\string
You can do it! Select Attacks.\wait 

\string

you just completed!\wait 

\string
Select a\color[44,101,255,255] Bros. Attack\color[0,0,0,255] here, and\\
then press the \color[44,101,255,255]Y\color[0,0,0,255] Button to see\\
a demonstration of the attack.\wait \pagebreak
When you're viewing a demo, you\\
can press\color[44,101,255,255] START\color[0,0,0,255] to jump in and\\
do a practice trial.\wait \pagebreak
I highly recommend practicing before\\
you try to use a\color[44,101,255,255] Bros. Attack\color[0,0,0,255]\\
\space[1]in battle!\wait 

\string
When you've seen the demo\\
and had your fill of practice,\\
go on and close the menu.\wait 

\string


\string
First, select Badges.\wait 

\string
Go on, select Badges!\wait 

\string
Changing badges is a snap.\wait 

\string
Use the \color[44,101,255,255]R\color[0,0,0,255] Button for the\color[255,51,51,255]\\
fella in red's\color[0,0,0,255] badges...\wait 

\string
And, of course, the \color[44,101,255,255]L\color[0,0,0,255] Button\\
for the\color[14,173,67,255] fella in green\color[0,0,0,255]!\wait 

\string
You can also tap and hold to\\
grab the badges and rotate the\\
wheel to the one you want.\wait \pagebreak
If you like tapping on stuff, I've\\
gotta say, this method is gonna\\
be the one for you!\wait 

\string
\code[1,4]Changing badge combos will\\
have all kinds of effects.\wait \pagebreak
The effects I'm talking about\\
are explained above the badge\\
wheels, so study up!\wait 

\string
\code[1,4]Oh, and, fellas? Here's the\\
most important thing!\wait \pagebreak
\code[1,4]Once you've decided what\\
badges to use, be sure to\color[44,101,255,255]\\
press the A Button\color[0,0,0,255]!\wait \pagebreak
\color[44,101,255,255]L and R\color[0,0,0,255] Buttons to switch\\
badges, then the \color[44,101,255,255]A\color[0,0,0,255] Button!\\
All you need to know!\wait 

\string
When you're done looking\\
around, close the menu, OK?\wait 

\string


\string
To lay eyes on the book you\\
just received, select Guide.\wait 

\string
Go on. Select Guide.\wait 

\string
Observe! A book icon\\
has been added here.\wait \pagebreak
Yes, the Ultibed manual.\\
Please select it.\wait 

\string
Focus. For now, just select\\
the Ultibed manual.\wait 

\string
This will keep a log of current\\
events and details regarding\\
the different bed parts.\wait 

\string
Once you've become one with the\\
information here, I ask that you\\
close the menu!\wait 

\string


\string
OK, please select Badges!\wait 

\string
Ahem! Just pick Badges for now!\wait 

\string
To switch badges around,\\
use the \color[44,101,255,255]L\color[0,0,0,255] and \color[44,101,255,255]R\color[0,0,0,255] Buttons\\
then hit the \color[44,101,255,255]A\color[0,0,0,255] Button!\wait \pagebreak
\code[1,4]Pretty basic method, right?\\
Don't forget!\wait 

\string
Any badge you find or buy will\\
offer distinct effects...\wait \pagebreak
So study up over here as you\\
select which effect you want!\wait 

\string
You should choose badges over\\
here by seeing how powerful\\
their effects will be!\wait 

\string
Of course, the ultimate effects\\
depend on the combination of\\
badges you end up using.\wait \pagebreak
So anytime you get a new badge,\\
check the Badges menu and see\\
what combos you can create!\wait 

\string
Each of you can hold up to six\\
badges, which means there are a\\
total of 36 potential combos!\wait 

\string
If you want, you can load up\\
one of you with as many\\
badges as possible...\wait \pagebreak
Or, if you feel like it, split\\
the badges you get between\\
the two of you!\wait 

\string
The more badges you pick up, the\\
more combos you can make and\\
the more fun you can have!\wait 

\string
Even with just the badges you have\\
now, there are several combos you\\
can make. Try a few out!\wait 

\string
Well, that's all the info I have\\
for you. Thanks for listening!\wait
