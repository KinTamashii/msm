All right! Goombas, fall in!
Huh... I guess we got a bunch of new recruits.
Well, it looks like this is a dead end.
And everyone who escaped from the Twinsy Tropics Dungeon has scattered.
What do we do now? It's terrible feeling so helpless...
There's another grab pole on the other side of this gap.
If you wanna cross it, well, I think it's pretty clear what you gotta do.

And this is just a rumor, but...
I heard that if you get the medallion back, you could get some coins too!
You just have to avoid fighting too many battles...

You saved all of the Toads!
Rescue all the Toads!
Be careful! If Bowser's minions get away with 3 Toads (1 Toad in Hard Mode), the quest will end.
Pay attention to the color of each Toad... It could be a hint!

AHH!
HELP!
EEEK!
All right, guys! Back to our patrol!
And where do you think you're going?!
I totally saw you guys trying to make a break for it!
Oh, what's this? You think you're gonna fight us?
Did you see that, guys? These jokesters wanna fight us!
Ha ha ha ha!
It's gonna be a little hard for you guys to fight...
without these!
Bowser's minions are all about a special ore you can find here in the Twinsy Tropics Dungeon.
As to what they're using it for, well, I haven't a clue.
I'm just a lowly prisoner, after all, so I'm not exactly kept in the loop on their evil plans.
We confiscated these from you before we threw you in the slammer.
So you can kiss attacking, fleeing, and using items good-bye, chumps!
The Bowsers are making us Toads mine a special ore and then haul it to their castle.
I'm sure they've got some dastardly plan, but I'm not clear on the details.
All I can say is, it's grueling work, and I'm not cut out for this kind of physical labor.
I barely even have legs, man!
They're ours now!
It's gonna be pretty tough fighting without attacking or recovering!
And therein lies the dilemma.
If you want your stuff back, you'll have to fight us for it.
We finally got all our stuff back!
But don't let your guard down again.
Well, all right, then. Let's get back to saving the worlds!

...weeeegeeeee!
So, folding it like this, I can add 35% more papertorque to the right hand...
But that will cost me 85 Yoshipower, and it's a bit awkward looking to boot. Hmm...
Whoooooa.
And the path is basically a giant puzzle?
Hey! Buddy!
And you have no idea how to get there?
Push the blue crescent and pink target stones into the corresponding slots.
Stones can move only on the tracks.
The papercraft is so awesome!
Hey! Stop hogging it!
It's half mine, you know!
OK, let's get down to brass tacks.
I knew it!
Exactly! That's bad news with a capital B! And N!
This is a job for a brave and braided genius...Toadette!
Hey, you made it all the way up here! Nice job!
It's wild how those platforms just came out of the wall like that.
I've lived here for a long time, and I've never seen anything like it!
However!
I'm gonna need lots of Paper Toad helpers...
And I need a safe place where I can work!
Bowser's minions already have a new papercraft!
I'm so high up!
If I were scared of heights, I would for sure be freaking out right now.
The only thing is it's a bit out of the way.
...Marioooo!
Guys! It's me!
Can you hear meeeeee?
Mount Brrr is the tallest mountain in the area, and you're about halfway to the summit!
Based on my research, there should be some contraptions around you.
Fiddle around with them in just the right way, and you should open a path to the village!
Whoa!
SO cool!
We need to get working on a new papercraft too.
Lucky for you, I've got more ideas than you can shake a stick at!
What do you mean there's no such thing as a safe place in this terrifying world?
After all, I heard there's a village of Toads in the west part of Mount Brrr.
That seems like a good spot to work!
What's that? It's way higher than you expected?
No problemo!
In my extensive research of the area, I learned that the puzzle of Mount Brrr CAN be solved!
And when you solve it, you'll have cleared a path straight to the Toad Village.
I have the most amazing idea for the new papercraft! But I have to percolate on it a bit...
So you guys should head to the Toad Village. I'll catch up with you.
All right! Goombas, fall in!
Huh... I guess we got a bunch of new recruits.
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
It's Mario! And it looks like the real deal this time!
Well, technically speaking, that other guy was real too, right?
I mean, sure, he was flatter, and it was weird how he floated down from the sky.
But does that make him any less real?
Anyway, whatever! Let's get him!
Maaario!
Boy, am I glad to see you!
You see, Princess Peach has—
Actually, it will be much easier if you just get to her castle and see for yourself.
Peach's Castle is this way!
You should head to Doop Doop Dunes next!
Besides, shouldn't you head to the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto next?
Heading to Bowser's Castle, right?
Well, first you want to go to the bridge in East Doop Doop Dunes!
We can use this paper trampoline to reach the two tall, spiky guys blocking the bridge.
OK, let's head back to the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto.
Once we get there, we'll bust out the paper trampoline.
Instead of a delivery, this time I come bearing a message from Toadette!
I will read it for you.
Ahem!
"Paper Toads will pave the way to Neo Bowser Castle!"
"A stack of Paper Toads, leading to the sky!"
"For now, though, please head to the top of Mount Brrr."
"Oh, and don't stop rescuing Paper Toads."
"If you save enough of them, they'll make you another awesome Trio Attack."
And that was the message!
Would you like to hear it again? 
No
Yes
This pipe is off limits for the time being because it connects to—
Whoops! I almost slipped some top-secret info there! Good thing I caught myself!
Please check again later.

You'll want to head east from here, so take the exit to the right. Good luck!
I hear Twinsy Tropics is a lovely place to kick back and relax.
To get there, head southeast from Doop Doop Dunes!
Headed to Bowser's Castle?
I heard a rumor that you can get there from the dungeon under Twinsy Tropics.
Looks like you've saved every Paper Toad! Nice work!
Now it's time to face off with the Bowsers for your final challenge!
Delivery Toad here, direct from Peach's Castle!
Here you go!
I peeked inside already, and it's a new Trio Attack!
And here's one more package for you.
You got a new Trio Attack, Trio Kite!

Well then, I'm off!
All right! Don't forget to save, OK?
Would you like to revisit a quest you've already played?
You can test your skills by playing the quest in Hard Mode!
Hi! Here to rescue some Paper Toads?
I can tell you guys are just itching to rescue some Paper Toads.
It's pretty big, so don't open it up in here!
There are no Paper Toad Rescue quests available for you right now.
For now, you should head over to the Goomba papercraft to meet Toadette!
This reminds me... Have you bought any new gear lately?
Let's check out the shops around here.
They might have some new stuff.
Using the same gear all the time can get kind of boring, don't you think?
Not that I'm saying you're boring...
But if you're in the market for some new, more powerful gear, stop in the shop behind me!
I find that a little retail therapy really soothes the nerves in times of calamity.
So go buy something once you have enough coins!
In the Twinsy Tropics Dungeon, there's a wall with a round hole.
I know there's something behind that wall, but I can't figure out how to access it.
I seriously can't stop thinking about this... It's keeping me up at night.
Bowser's Castle is airborne?! What in the world is going on?!
I'm seriously considering running away from here.
Marioooo!
Wait for meeee!
If only I could fold myself into a paper boat and sail back home. 
But who's to say the sea wouldn't swallow me whole?
And who even knows what's on the other side of the sea? 
Will I ever see my home again?
Or am I destined to live the rest of my days as an exile?
Maybe we're all just paper boats being tossed around on the sea of fate.
Whether we sink or stay afloat is totally beyond our control.
Waaaaaaah!
How long have you guys been standing there?!
That was a PRIVATE soliloquy...
Huh? You're all looking to cross the sea too?
Hmmm, OK...
Well, I could make a boat for us to use! How does that sound?
Sounds like a plan!
I just need some more Paper Toads to help me make the boat.
There's a Lakitu Info Center east of here.
Go there to rescue some other Paper Toads, OK?
I've spent a lot of time listening to the sea... So much time that I understand its words.
The Bowsers' plans have upset the order of things, and the sea is angry!
Can you hear it in the waves? No? Really? You don't hear anything at all?
You have to listen harder, then!
Apparently Toads from all over are being abducted by Bowser's minions.
What's that? You just freed a whole bunch from an underground prison?
Great job, Mario! And you too, Luigi...
Even so... I still can't help but worry about my safety.
What in the world is Bowser plotting?
And we figured that since we're headed to Peach's Castle anyway...
we'd give the Paper Toads a lift!
The sea is so incredibly beautiful...
Staring at it almost makes me forget all the friends Bowser's minions have kidnapped.
Almost...but not quite.
Thanks for your help, guys! Good luck out there!
Welcome to Twinsy Tropics' shopping district.
Of course, it's not exaaaactly a "district," and there are only three shops.
Still, though, what we lack in quantity we definitely make up for in quality.
And maybe even value! Though the operative word there is "maybe."
Well then, let's head out!
I first came to Twinsy Tropics on vacation, but then the boat home disappeared in a storm.
So I guess this is my new home now. I can't complain, though. It's paradise here!
What about you guys? Are you on permanent vacation too?
What's that? We have some additional passengers?
Aren't battle cards the greatest?
If you use them well, you can really blast through fights!
This shop here sells them, so you should drop in if you have the chance!
I just love checking out new types of battle cards.
Oh, gotcha!
Lately, all kinds of baddies have been appearing in our tropical paradise.
I guess Bowser's minions must like soaking up the sun too...
We're quite isolated here, so I don't know if this is happening all through the Mushroom Kingdom.
I've seen lots of baddies prowling around.
And then there's the rumor that Bowser's Castle is closer than we thought.
I have no idea how to get there, though... Is there a secret path?
I guess I should be more stressed out about this...
But it's hard to stress while chilling on the beach in a tropical paradise.
Island life is nice and all, but sometimes I'd like a change of scenery.
I'd love to take a year off and just travel around...
...What's that you say? There's no time like the present?
You're right! I'm going to wander the Mushroom Kingdom!
I'll even write a travelogue. Guess I'd better get packing!
Do you hear what the sea is saying? You have to listen very carefully.
Keep listening... Keep listening... Do you hear it now?
...Oh, wait, that's not the sea at all. That's just my belly! I need a snack!
You have to be patient if you want to understand what the sea is saying.
Listen carefully... Listen VEEEEERY carefully...
To be honest, this could take a while. The sea speaks very slowly.
Aha! You heard that, right? The sea just said something!
I can tell from your face that you understood what it said too. It said...
"Keep listening..."
What?! Come on now, sea! Stop messing with us!
Please go to the Lakitu Info Center and rescue some more Paper Toads.
When you get enough, we'll start building the boat.
And we'll navigate the uncertain seas of fate...together!
We finished the boat!
It's our best work yet!
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
It rides like a dream too!
Well, climb aboard and make yourself at home!
We're so relieved there's finally a way off this island!
What's that? You want to know if we'll be riding with you in the boat?
Actually, we found a different method of transportation...
Yep, we'll handle taking the Paper Toads to Peach's Castle.
Don't worry about a thing!
We had the good luck of bumping into a Lakitu while we were building the boat.
Are you making the most of your battle cards?
I recommend dropping by the card shop every once in a while to see what they have.
There's nothing like going into battle with a really sweet battle card set!
Everybody's freaking out about Bowser's Castle floating above Mount Brrr!
Some Toads have already fled the area, and I'm thinking about following them...
You guys might want to consider running away too!
Did you not notice that we're TWO BOWSERS?
So, Mario...
Your stubbornness is extremely annoying.
This isn't...over...
But at least we've had plenty of time to come up with a plan.
Must...protect...book...
That way we'll never have to see your stupid mustaches ever again...
Pfft. Two Marios.
And...other Mario! And Luigi...
Let's do this!
And the Mushroom Kingdom will be MINE!
I meant what I said! You got a problem with that?
Not if we can help it!
I don't know why you're so confident. We have TWO Marios!
And a green gu—Luigi too!

And...that yellow thing and that green guy.
Fine! Just don't get in my way!
We've got enough arms and legs to stomp ALL of you!
Well, well, well...
I guess we'll have to do this ourselves!

Next, we're gonna trap you in this book!

Do you have what it takes to meet today's challenge and earn a special reward?
You'll need to clear  or more quests!
To reach that number, you'll have to try some quests in Hard Mode. Good luck!
If you're heading to Mount Brrr, you'll need to pass through the rest of Gloomy Woods first.

Toadette said to keep after the princesses!
You'll want to head east from here, so take the exit to the right. Good luck!
I hear Twinsy Tropics is a lovely place to kick back and relax.
To get there, head southeast from Doop Doop Dunes!
Headed to Bowser's Castle?
I heard a rumor that you can get there from the dungeon under Twinsy Tropics.
Looks like you've saved every Paper Toad! Nice work!
Now it's time to face off with the Bowsers for your final challenge!
Delivery Toad here, direct from Peach's Castle!
Here you go!
I peeked inside already, and it's a new Trio Attack!
And here's one more package for you.
You got a new Trio Attack, Trio Kite!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice using it!
You got a new Trio Attack, Trio Whirligig!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice using it!
You got a new Trio Attack, Trio Meteor!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice using it!
You got a paper trampoline!
It's too big to set up here. Set it up later when you need to use it!
Well then, I'm off!
All right! Don't forget to save, OK?
Even if there are no available Paper Toad Rescue quests, you should still talk to the desk attendant.
He might be able to give you some info on where you should be headed.
Would you like to revisit a quest you've already played?
You can test your skills by playing the quest in Hard Mode!
Hi! Here to rescue some Paper Toads?
I can tell you guys are just itching to rescue some Paper Toads.
It's pretty big, so don't open it up in here!
There are no Paper Toad Rescue quests available for you right now.
For now, you should head over to the Goomba papercraft to meet Toadette!
Yes, that's it! It was underground in the dungeon...
All right, last question. This one's for Paper Mario!
Where was the symbol in the dungeon? 
In a cell. 
Roy was holding it. 
On a suspicious wall.
I don't remember finding anything in those cells but a shocking disregard for creature comfort!
Try again, Paper Mario. Really rack your brain!
Wow! You're just full of surprises, Paper Mario!
They got away with the princesses again.
Right, we're TRYING to rescue them, Luigi!
I don't know about that, Paper Mario.
I remember Roy holding a giant rock at one point, but not anything like this.
Why don't you try one more time?
Yeah, we'll definitely jump on the Bowser Jrs.' heads when we find them...
But that's the whole problem. How do we find them?
Oh, right! They dropped that just now. It seems important!
I feel like we've seen that symbol somewhere before...
Yes! I think you've got it!
Maybe that's the key to getting into Bowser's Castle...
Well, there's only one way to find out. Back to the Twinsy Tropics Dungeon!
Really? In the Toad Village?
Luigi, I'm just going to tell you flat out—you're wrong.
Give it another try, will you?
You know, it was pretty dark in those woods.
I don't remember seeing much of ANYTHING.
Are you completely sure it wasn't somewhere else?
Mario, I like where you're going with that, but something tells me it just won't fly...
Listen to Paper Mario. You've got plenty of unique skills of your own!
I know you and Luigi can't fold up into planes, but that's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.
Besides, Paper Mario here can take care of all the papery tricks.
The three of you make a great team!
So, moving on...
Whoa...
That is really cool!
Where have we seen that symbol before? 
Peach's Castle. 
Twinsy Tropics. 
Gloomy Woods.
Peach's Castle, eh? Was it in a storage room or something?
Because it does seem to have Bowser's face on it... 
That doesn't really seem like something Princess Peach would keep around.
Let's think about this a little bit more...
That's it! Twinsy Tropics! I definitely remember seeing it there.
But, um...where exactly? What do you think, Luigi?
Where in Twinsy Tropics did we see it? 
In the dungeon. 
On the beach. 
In the Toad Village.
Hmm...I sure don't remember any ugly Bowser faces mucking up the beach...
Let's keep thinking, shall we?

Got it. Be careful, guys!
I'll wait here, OK?
Remember, I need 2 more pieces of Fire Ore. Thanks!
You found some ore? Let's see it!
Oh. That's the piece we already had!
There are 2 more out there... Go get 'em!
Great! Now there's just 1 piece left...
Yes! That's it! Now I've got all the Fire Ore I need.
You guys aren't going to believe what I can do with that Fire Ore...
Your next papercraft is really going to bring the heat!
Why don't you go ahead for now, and I'll bring it to you when it's ready?
I gave you 1, but I need 3 pieces of Fire Ore in total, remember? Thanks in advance!
Now, I'm no ballistics expert...but I don't think we should be standing here when this thing goes off...
There he is! That purple guy!
He's the one who's been stealing all of Master Bowser's treasured possessions!
GET HIM!
AHAHAHA!
Chase after Nabbit? 
No
Yes
They actually made it!
Can you believe it? Mario's here!
Oh, great idea!
I bet our dads would like that too.
So any idea where the book is now?
Nope, no clue. Hmm...
Heeey.
Kameeek!
It's like looking into a funhouse mirror. Crazy!
But anyway, you showed up at just the right time. It was getting boring around here. 
The name's Bowser Jr. Pleased to meetcha!
No way! That's MY name too! Wow! OK then, let's get this party started!
By the way, there's something I've been wondering. Where are you from, anyway?
I flew out of that book, same as my dad.
Hmm...
Does that mean if we had the book, you'd have to go home?
Yeah, probably.
But hanging out together is the only thing keeping us from dying of boredom!
Yeah, going home would be super lame.
Wait, I have an idea!
Let's just find the book and destroy it! Problem solved!
For now, let's go rescue those Paper Toads!
I don't think this is the way to Peach's Castle...
↑Sunbeam Plains ← Peach's Castle
Look! Isn't that Mario?
I dunno... Something seems different about him...
Huh, you're right. Mario's a round guy, but not this round.
Why are you all giving me the hairy eyeball?
Golly, get a load of this guy!
He's flatter than a pita pocket.
Hey! Back off!
Get your mitts off me!
That's my face you're folding!
I'm all bent out of shape now!
Let's give these brutes a taste of their own medicine!
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
Thank you, Paper Mario! That was some quick thinking!
All right. We'll see you back at the castle, OK?
I don't know what Bowser is up to with that flying castle, but I'm sure it isn't good.
And he still has our book! We've got to come up with a plan...
But we can't expect everything to be a cakewalk.
Those are my shoes you're crumpling!
Ow! Ow! OW!
Right. Remember what Paper Princess Peach said...
If both versions of Bowser's minions teamed up, things could get pretty sticky.
QUIT IT!
Uh... You OK there, buddy?
No, I'm not OK! Did you see the way they manhandled me?
You'd better watch yourself. Next time I'm coming back with a whole stack!
Then we'll see who's the crumpler and who's the crumplee!
Those goons were pretty flimsy after all.
Anyone else have a weird, shivery feeling?
I hope it's just this breeze and not something more ominous.
You've reunited with Paper Mario!
Yes! Now we're back to full strength!
All right, the sooner we get out of this creepy forest, the better.
I'm sure that Wiggler—er, I mean Flutter— will give us another ride to Mount Brrr.
You've reunited with Mario!
You've reunited with the real Paper Mario!
Mario! I'm so glad you're safe!
It was touch and go with Luigi there for a little while...
Where's Luigi, you ask?
Well, about that... Look down.
Aww, you guys are so cute.
Now we just need to find Paper Mario!

Oh, come on now! Waylaid again?!

So this is the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto...
All right! Everybody, up up up!
Let's put on our thinking caps, fellas!
Those two clearly aren't going to let us pass without a fight.
So we're gonna have to take the fight to them.
But they're way up there, and we're down here.
If only we had a way to jump really high...
Well, mull it over.
In the meantime, let's explore this area for anything that might help us get back on track.
How are we ever going to make it to Bowser's Castle at this rate?
And that's that! Good work, team!
Now let's hurry to Bowser's Castle! The princesses need our help!
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
It's true we asked for something to help us jump really high.
But those Paper Toads really went above and beyond!
That said, good job sticking the landing, guys.
Though I guess you HAVE had a lot of practice falling.
Now all we have to do is take care of those guys.

Thanks for your patronage!
Come back anytime you want to talk more!
This incident has really woken me up.
We need to always be prepared for the worst-case scenario!
I'm going to go stock up on peanut butter right now...
To soldier on in the face of all this...
It...it almost brings a tear to my eye.
Do you want to hear more about sparkle cards? 
No
Yes
You're in the right place! What do you want to know? 
What exactly are sparkle cards? 
How do you get them? 
What's so awesome about them? 
Actually, I'm fine.
Sparkle cards are a rare breed of card that can't be purchased in stores!
They sparkle like diamonds, and they're equally precious!
Do you struggle with the same problems battle after battle?
If so, you came to the right Toad!
I've heard that some enemies drop sparkle cards when you defeat them...
But that almost sounds too good to be true! And I don't know which enemies drop them...
Sure, I can help you with that.
Besides being beautiful, sparkle cards use half the amount of Star Points.
This means you can use them more often in battle. Is that nifty or what?
The eternal question. Should you re-up Paper Mario's copies or do a Trio Attack?
Well, this is the card that says, "Why not both?"
Yes, with this fine battle card, you can refill Paper Mario's copies to the max.
Then simply select your favorite Trio Attack and go to town!
Some might say that's simply asking too much. But I disagree!
With this battle card, you can recover HP each time you're attacked!
You'll actually be happy to be attacked! What a concept!
Now, it's a bit pricey. But I think you'll find it's worth every single gold coin.
Oh dear... The details of this battle card are still a secret!
Hee hee hee! I'm sure I've piqued your curiosity, but please ask about it later!
Due to incredible demand, we're totally sold out of cards!
Thank you for purchasing so many!
What's troubling you? 
I want more copies of Paper Mario! 
I want to recover without using items. 
Nothing. I'm fine.
So, you want to hear about sparkle cards? 
Yes, please!
Nah, that's OK.
Welcome to the item shop!
Rest assured that no matter how chaotic things get out there, we will remain open.
Use our gear to beat Bowser!
Welcome to the card shop!
As long as you're adventuring, we'll be here to sell you cards.
Hey, where are you going?!
We have to stay along this path!
Golly! The drill dash really packs a punch. This is bound to come in handy.
If you want to practice the move some more, just look at the guide.
By the way...
There's that rumbling again!
There's something kind of curious about that platform, don't you think?
What the heck could it be?
I think a little Trio Drill action there might uncover something cool!
Is it coming from above us?
Whoa! You can tunnel into the ground to move under obstacles! That's pretty cool!

Whew! That was a close call!
If we weren't careful, it could've been curtains for us!
Stuff like this doesn't just accidentally fall from the sky.

You all OK?
I'm glad to hear that.

MARIOOOOO!
EEEEEEE!
All right, I've got to get back to Peach's Castle.
You guys go on ahead without me, OK?
I did some snooping around, and I'm pretty sure the princesses are on the top floor.
So I'll see you back at Peach's Castle, OK? After you rescue the princesses, of course!
Aww, Luigi, don't worry!
I can take care of myself, you know.
I've tracked a treasure or two in my day, gentlemen.
See you later! Good luck!
Oh, great. It's Mario...
Master Kamek gave me a direct order to grab Toadette!
You think I'm just gonna let her go now?

I need to deliver  of them... Can you help me out?
What is wrong with me today? I just can't keep the mushrooms in the bag!
How will I ever deliver  of them at this rate?
Well, this is just ridiculous.
As soon as I deliver my  mushrooms, I am taking the rest of the day off!

There must be some way out of here!
We'll just wait for him to take himself out!

We pledge to take him out!
Oh, great idea!
I bet our dads would like that too.
So any idea where the book is now?
Nope, no clue. Hmm...
Heeey.
Kameeek!
Sure, we'll get a reward for watching the princesses, but...
We destroyed the bridge, Master Bowser!
And what about Mario's crew?
I'm sorry to report that they were not hit.
But the link between your castle and Doop Doop Dunes has been demolished!
Hmph, can't you grunts do anything right? The goal is to take out MARIO!
Luckily, I've planned for your incompetence!
Just keep firing!
We've got enough cannonballs to overcome your pathetic aim!

By the way, there's something I've been wondering. Where are you from, anyway?
I flew out of that book, same as my dad.
Hmm...
Does that mean if we had the book, you'd have to go home?
Yeah, probably.
But hanging out together is the only thing keeping us from dying of boredom!
Yeah, going home would be super lame.
Wait, I have an idea!
Let's just find the book and destroy it! Problem solved!

I believe that should be the last of Mario and his crew.
And I was thinking...
Perhaps Paper Bowser has outgrown his usefulness...
Well, sir. I did have an idea...
Master Bowser...
It involves that book over there...
Boom! Nailed it!
Fire!
Bahaha! Thanks to the hard work of a few unpaid Toads, we're flying in style!
FIRE!
With power like this at my disposal, the Mushroom Kingdom doesn't stand a chance!
I'll rule the land with an iron fist!
I'm gonna bury them with cannonballs! This is for giving Junior an owie!
Yeah. Whatever.
Yes. He does annoy me to no end.
But he's also pretty strong. Nearly my equal!
Master Bowser...
Perhaps Bowser has outgrown his usefulness...
Well, sir. I did have an idea...
It involves that book over there...
You mean WE'LL rule with iron FISTS, right?
Yes. He does annoy me to no end.
But he's also pretty strong. Nearly my equal!
Is everything all right in there? Were any of Toadette's projects damaged?
Nope, everything's fine! That's quality craftsmanship for you!
We get attacked by Bowser all the time in our world too.
So this isn't that big of a deal, to be honest.
The Lakitu who normally works here isn't around...
Which is probably for the best, since that pillar looks a bit shaky right now.
The damage isn't so bad over here. But Bowser still owes us a brand-new castle!
Looks like the back area didn't take much damage...
Luckily, that's where most of the Paper Toads were hanging out.
I just hope this doesn't sour them on visiting our world.
I'm trying to get a little B&B going as a side business, you see...
I'm doing just fine—thanks for asking!
I don't know what I'll do if I can't get back to my world...
Do you think Princess Peach will let us stay at her castle?
We don't take up much space!
There are voices coming from the other side of the door...
Did you perhaps have an errand for Flutter?
I'm sure she'll be back once her belly is full!
Would you like to return to Gloomy Woods? 
No
Yes
Then hop on!
When you want to go back to Gloomy Woods, come talk to me.
I'll be waiting here for you!
All right, we're here! Sure is cold up here...
I wish I could take you guys all the way to the top, but they keep shooting off those cannons.
So this is as far as I go. Good luck getting all the way to the castle!
Mariooooo! Up here!
Remember the pipe to the village that was under construction?
Well, it's all done! Now you can go straight to town from here!
Aww, that's great! I used to give the Toads rides, but this is more convenient.
Stay warm, guys! I'll see you next time!
Oh, hi there. I have a message for you from Flutter.
She said that she was heading to Gloomy Woods to eat some more berries.
Apparently her blood sugar was getting low or something.
She apologized for the inconvenience and said she would be back before too long.
Just hop in that pipe to get to the Toad Village! It's so convenient...
Wait...what am I doing telling YOU about pipes?

You saved all of the Paper Toads!
Eeeeeeeeeek!
Thanks to you guys, most of the kidnapped Toads have escaped the Twinsy Tropics Dungeon.
But some poor Toads are still down there, toiling away in the dark.
Oh, it's just too awful to think about! Won't you go underground and help them? 
Not right now.
OK.
This village used to have a boat that traveled between here and other places.
But the boat was swept away during a particularly bad storm...
That's why the tourist situation has been pretty sparse lately.
Bowser's minions have been plotting away in the Twinsy Tropics Dungeon.
And then I keep hearing this rumor that Bowser's Castle is actually very close by...
I moved here to chill on the beach. I did not sign up for all this intrigue!
You know that ore that the Toads have been forced to mine?
I guess it's actually the energy that lets Bowser's Castle float in the sky.
Is it me, or does it seem like the Bowsers just keep getting eviler and eviler?
Well... I guess they can toil a little longer. Let me know when you're ready to help them.
You guys freed all the kidnapped Toads from the Twinsy Tropics Dungeon! Thank you!
Once again, you really saved the day! Now I can finally stop worrying about this.
You know that purple ore in the Twinsy Tropics Dungeon?
We should start selling it as a local specialty!
We could repackage it with a catchy name, like "The Miracle Happy Stone!"
It's the stone that brings the tranquility of the tropics straight to you!
If we market it just right, we could make boatloads of money!
What's that? It sounds like something you'd buy off an infomercial?
Aw, man, I thought it was a great idea...
You may have passed my test...
...but there are 4 other know-it-all Toads out there waiting for a challenge!

Now, don't go resting on your laurels. There are more challenges to conquer!
Visit one of the Lakitu Info Centers and go from there...
I can't believe it... You passed ALL of the know-it-all Toads' tests?
That's amazing! I never thought I'd see the day...
Well, fair's fair, so here's your reward. Enjoy!
Building a house is hard work, especially when it's two stories, like this one.
What's that? You want to know how to get to the second story?
Hee hee hee! That's a secret!
That guy likes talking about how this house is two stories, but the truth is...
the entrance to the second story is in a super-inconvenient place.
We actually don't get there very often because of it.
Whaddaya think? Wanna try me? 
No
Yes
Very well! I will show you how thoroughly I have mastered each branch of the tree of knowledge!
You got Mushroom Gloves!
If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?
Yes, it does. Because physics. Hah!
That's the kind of thing I know because I'm the smartest Toad in these woods.
Are you guys feeling pretty smart as well? We could have a contest of sorts...
You got 3 Speed Beans!
Here's a little something for winning. You earned it!
Isn't the world simply packed with fascinating things to learn? I just live to soak it all up!
Well done, Mario! I really underestimated you!
I understand. You have things to do— people to rescue.
I'm always up for a challenge, so come see me if you change your mind.
Although I'm the smartest, there are a total of 5 know-it-all Toads in this world.

Ha! We got you now!
No more escaping for you!
I'm gonna go ahead and sneak out of here now.
Maybe we'll meet again someday...
To add insult to injury, I bumped the cell door shut when I was mopping, so now I'm stuck!
I can't figure out what the Bowsers are doing with all that ore.
It tastes terrible, so they can't be eating it. And I doubt they're making jewelry with it...
Could they be using it as a fuel source?
Pondering this really helps pass the time.
This crack is my ticket to freedom, but I haven't been able to squeeze through yet.
I just gotta keep pushing... I'll get out eventually. Hrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!
Nice work! Of course, I did most of the heavy lifting, showing you how to use battle cards like that...
That's OK—you can thank me later. I have one more thing to show you.
Pssst! Guys! Over here!
It's me! The Goomba you battled twice back in Sunbeam Plains.
After you guys crumped me that second time, management said I was unfit to be a minion.
And they demoted me to janitor, which is why I'm here cleaning up the cells.
It's humiliating, and it's all your fault! 
Wait!
You can't just leave me here! At least tell me how you broke free!
I wanna escape and go live my own life. I'm through working for Bowser!
If you help me get out of here, I'll give you something good in return!
And I'll forget about all the bad stuff you did to me!
Here! Have this!
You got a battle card set!
See? I told you I had something good for you. Those cards will help you out in battle.
OK, now it's your turn. Help me outta here!
Sheesh, that's brilliant! Why didn't I think of that?
You should head to Doop Doop Dunes next!
Besides, shouldn't you head to the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto next?
Heading to Bowser's Castle, right?
Well, first you want to go to the bridge in East Doop Doop Dunes!
We can use this paper trampoline to reach the two tall, spiky guys blocking the bridge.
OK, let's head back to the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto.
Once we get there, we'll bust out the paper trampoline.
Instead of a delivery, this time I come bearing a message from Toadette!
I will read it for you.
Ahem!
"Paper Toads will pave the way to Neo Bowser Castle!"
"A stack of Paper Toads, leading to the sky!"
"For now, though, please head to the top of Mount Brrr."
"Oh, and don't stop rescuing Paper Toads."
"If you save enough of them, they'll make you another awesome Trio Attack."
And that was the message!
Would you like to hear it again? 
No
Yes
This pipe is off limits for the time being because it connects to—
Whoops! I almost slipped some top-secret info there! Good thing I caught myself!
Please check again later.
Everyone!
Great! The more Paper Toads you rescue, the faster we'll get a new papercraft built for you.

Thanks to your efforts, the village is now teeming with Paper Toads!
Want to revisit a quest that you've already played? Then you're in the right place!
I'm heading back to the village center to get cracking on this new papercraft.
It's gonna be a real doozy, but I'll need a little longer to get it built.
In the meantime, you guys should go after Bowser Jr. and rescue the princesses!
I'm off to work!
Do you have a minute?
Sure. What's up?
I need you to make a delivery to a client on the upper part of Mount Brrr.

I hear Twinsy Tropics is a lovely place to kick back and relax.
To get there, head southeast from Doop Doop Dunes!
Headed to Bowser's Castle?
I heard a rumor that you can get there from the dungeon under Twinsy Tropics.
Sorry—this entrance is reserved for a very special client.
Sorry—I can't tell you who our very special client is!
Looks like you've saved every Paper Toad! Nice work!
Now it's time to face off with the Bowsers for your final challenge!
When it's a slow news day, we also make deliveries.
Lucky for us, we have lots of loyal clients.
Delivery Toad here, direct from Peach's Castle!
Here you go!
I peeked inside already, and it's a new Trio Attack!
And here's one more package for you.
You got a new Trio Attack, Trio Kite!

You're here to rescue more Paper Toads, right?
Would you like to revisit a quest you've already played?
You can test your skills by playing the quest in Hard Mode!
Hi! Here to rescue some Paper Toads?
I can tell you guys are just itching to rescue some Paper Toads.
It's pretty big, so don't open it up in here!
There are no Paper Toad Rescue quests available for you right now.
For now, you should head over to the Goomba papercraft to meet Toadette!

Boy, that was fun!
At first I just wanted to get away from Bowser's minions.
And then I found myself sort of enjoying my time as a hat...

Hey, Mario! Check out my new hat! You like it?

Best hat ever, right?
What would you say is your favorite thing about it? 
The color.
The material.
I agree. But would you believe it's made of paper?
Go on—touch it! 
No, thanks.
OK.
Not into fashion, are you? Oh well.
Yeah, the color is good. But the color isn't even my favorite part!
Your loss, bro! Let me know if you change your mind.
Hoo boy, this is exciting! Go for it!
You Found All Toads Within the Given Time!
There's nothing to fear in this area. I wonder why they're hiding...
Hello, Mario! Looking for Paper Toads?
Here's a tip—they can fold themselves into all kinds of crazy shapes!
I can't believe my hat was actually a Paper Toad!
I really liked that hat...
This is for earlier! I'm still mad about it!
Ow! That was just beginner's luck!
Why, you! I oughta...
Aaaugh! My face!
You haven't seen the last of me, Mario!
All right, I think you've learned your lesson. Now take this and get out of here!

Hey, guys. Don't be too upset.
This isn't the first time we've had to repair the castle.
We'll be back in business before you know it!
Ugh, what a mess. At least no one got hurt.
To get to Mount Brrr, you've got to go through Gloomy Woods.
And now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to faint in terror.
I've never seen a metal ball fly through the air quite like that...
Won't anyone think of the carpets? Those beautiful red carpets...

You got a piece of Fire Ore! There's 1 left!
Yes, my ore is very pretty, but I don't see how it's going to help you defeat my papercraft!
So...STOP TOUCHING IT!
You got a piece of Fire Ore! Take it to Toadette!

You OK?
The bridge is old and rickety! Use caution when crossing it!
Huh? What did you guys just come up with?
Nice work, fellas! Now you can reach stuff that's far away!
If you ever want to practice this move, just hop on over to the guide.
You learned a new move, Trio Grab!
Instructions for how to use it have been added to the guide!
You got a key!
All right! Let's make our way back outside.
Who knows what kind of havoc the Bowsers are wreaking out there...
We also need to find that book, so keep your eyes peeled.
It would be a real disaster if it were to fall into the wrong hands...
Press  or  to switch to the Grab action icon.
Press →→ in order to do Trio Grab!
Press  to reach and grab!
Would you like to practice? 
No
Yes
And, of course, we can't forget about the princesses. They need our help too.
Whew! This heroing business sure requires a lot of multitasking.
Don't you want to try out the new move you learned?
Where are you going?
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
Use Mario's hammer to send back the regular cannonballs Morton throws.
And use Trio Hammer to send the HUGE cannonballs flying back!

Hey, guys, look over there!
I don't remember seeing that paper terrain the last time we were here.
I wonder if it will take us someplace new. Let's go check it out!
Welcome to the item shop! How can I help you today?
Unfortunately for Toads, beans don't power us up.
They just power up our chili recipes!
Oh, and once you buy or find items... don't just carry them around—use 'em!
You can't take it with you, you know?
I'm not just saying this to get you to buy more items, but...
you should buy more items! They can really help you out in a tough spot.
Have you found any beans in the ground or walls?
They can help power up your stats, you know!

I've heard about a book that holds a parallel world within its pages.
I thought it was just the stuff of legend...
But based on what you've just told me, perhaps this book is, in fact, real.
And it sounds like it's in Princess Peach's castle!
Gwahahaha!
What's the big idea, copycat?
We've completely destroyed Mario and his crew!
I'd like to see you try!
And that would explain this little situation here.
The plan is also proceeding nicely. The Toads are hard at work underground.
They're working so hard, one might even characterize it as "toiling."
What?! It's pretty obvious that YOU'RE the copycat!
Daaaad!
What is it, Junior?
Daaad! I'M your son!
Look what I have!
Son, I'm busy right now. We can talk later.
I like special surprises! OK, let's go to the villa!
Whyyyy meeee? Standing guard is the most boring job in the world!
Yeah! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Mario! Save me!
Man, I'm so bored!
...
This lookout duty is the worst! Where's the action?
...
Hey! You two!
KABLAM!
Try escaping or something! I can't take this anymore!
Minion! What's the status of that plan of ours?
You could at least say something different every once in a while. Yeesh!
Ah, yes, the plan. It's, er, trucking along.
And anyway, Mario's not coming!
Right about now he's probably being dangled over some lava.
Yikes!
Who the heck is this guy?!
Grrr! Stop saying that! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
*sigh*
What kind of progress report is that?!
Speed it up! Get it done!
That's IT.
Our hammers fly high!
Hey!
Y-yes, sir!
Our hammers fly fast!
We're heading out to the villa now!
And sometimes our hammers even hit something!
And so are you!
What the heck happened?!
Bowser's Castle
Where the heck am I?!
Minion! What's the status of that plan of ours?
Sheesh, would it kill you to say please?
Ah, yes, Master Bowser, the plan. It's, er, trucking along.
What kind of progress report is that?!
Speed it up! Get it done!
Y-yes, sir!
ROOOOOOAR!
Where the heck am I?!
Sheesh, would it kill you to say please?
A thousand apologies, Your Highness! I was only talking to myself!
Hey there, buddy.
I'm bored out of my mind.
Even your insults are knockoffs! Get out before I rearrange your face!
And his sidekick, Luigi!
Oh, yeah, me too.
I'd like to see you try!
And I want to nip this little Mario problem at the bud!
Tell the minions to hunt them down and destroy them!
A.k.a. the man in green!
There must be some way out of here!
We'll just wait for him to take himself out!
Oh, that's brilliant!
Master Booooowwwser!
I've got our way out!
Master Bowser!
Once we're done here, let's go find that book!
What is it?! Can't you see I'm busy?!
What is it?! Can't you see I'm busy?!
Uh, sorry to interrupt.
I'll let you go back to, er, whatever you were doing.
Uh, sorry to interrupt...
I'll let you go back to, um, whatever it is you were doing.
Coming from you, that's a compliment!
Have a Hertz doughnut, paperweight!
Have a Hertz doughnut, paperweight!
Ugh! Blech! That's nothing compared to my knuckle sandwich!
Ugh, blech! That's nothing compared to my knuckle sandwich!
Who is our enemy?
Ow! Stop pulling my hair, you lousy cheat!
Ow!
What is it?! Can't you see I'm busy?!
ARGH!
Quit it!
Master Bowser is, er, occupied at the moment. Can I help you?
We pledge to take him out!
Oh, great idea!
I bet our dads would like that too.
So any idea where the book is now?
Nope, no clue. Hmm...
Heeey.
Kameeek!
That said, you picked a pretty nice style to jack!
You dirty cheat!
Thanks!
It's like looking into a funhouse mirror. Crazy!
But anyway, you showed up at just the right time. It was getting boring around here. 
Sure, we'll get a reward for watching the princesses, but...
The name's Bowser Jr. Pleased to meetcha!
No way! That's MY name too! Wow! OK then, let's get this party started!
My head is starting to hurt...
No one likes a whiner, Junior.
Master Bowser! Please calm down!
We don't care! We don't wanna do it! We hate guard duty!
Hey! Can I get a little assistance here?
Why not send the young masters to the villa? The fresh air would do them good.
...And the peace and quiet would do US some good.
Ow ow ow! Leave me out of this!
I'm sure the papercraft will provide a welcome diversion.
Right, I almost forgot!
Junior, I have a special surprise just for you!
But if you want it, you'll have to go to the villa!
...Has His Highness taken up ventriloquism?
But won't it be obvious that we've escaped?
My word!
Not with...this!
Ta-daaaa! A helpful Toad gave me this for situations exactly like this.
It may not fool the Bowsers, but perhaps the Bowser Jrs. won't be so perceptive.
I'm going outside.
I'm so tired of getting kidnapped.
I mean, it's not all bad. I actually don't mind flying in the clown car. But...
If I have to say, "Save me, Mario!" one more time, I'm going to scream.
Now's our chance!
Good idea!
I want you to keep an eye on the princesses, Son.
Let's just sneak out that window...
What the heck just happened?!
A thousand apologies, Your Highness! I was only talking to myself!
Why is it so cooooold...?
We destroyed the bridge, Master Bowser!
...Has His Highness taken up ventriloquism?
Brrr!
And what about Mario's crew?
My word!
*zzz* *zzz*
I'm sorry to report that they were not hit.
But the link between your castle and Doop Doop Dunes has been demolished!
Who the heck is this guy?!
Hmph, can't you grunts do anything right? The goal is to take out MARIO!
Luckily, I've planned for your incompetence!
It's like looking into a funhouse mirror. Crazy!
You showed up at just the right time.
It was getting boring around here. 
But...but...but...but!
Just keep firing!
The name's Bowser Jr.
Pleased to meetcha!
We've got enough cannonballs to overcome your pathetic aim!
Er, Master Bowser?
My eyes must be playing tricks on me. There are...TWO Master Bowsers?
But...but...but...but!
I don't know how you got in, but you'd better get out!
This is MY castle, you scrawny knockoff!
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
Who the heck is this guy?!
Oh, puh-lease!
YOU'RE the knockoff!
My eyes must be playing tricks on me. There are...TWO Master Bowsers?
I don't know how you snuck in, but get out!
This is MY castle, you flimsy knockoff!
Oh, puh-lease!
YOU'RE the knockoff!
Let's go show the book to Dad! I bet he'll get a kick out of it.
Even your insults are knockoffs! Get out before I rearrange your face!
The man in red!
Yikes!
Grrrrrr...
With the mustache!
Master Booooowwwser!
The hateful Mario!
What is it?! Can't you see I'm busy?!
Hammer Bros., let me hear you!
Ow! Stop pulling my hair, you lousy cheat!
Bob-ombs!
Coming from you, that's a compliment!
By the way, there's something I've been wondering. Where are you from, anyway?
I flew out of that book, same as my dad.
Hmm...
Does that mean if we had the book, you'd have to go home?
Yeah, probably.
Do you ever feel that way?
Ugh!
There's a flurry of flat Toads and minions pouring down all over the Mushroom Kingdom!
But hanging out together is the only thing keeping us from dying of boredom!
Master Bowser!
Say what now?
Yeah, going home would be super lame.
Wait, I have an idea!
Why you!
Let's just find the book and destroy it! Problem solved!
A whole mess of paper things came flying out of Peach's Castle.
This is all starting to make some sense.
Yep! So if everyone's on board...
Anyway, could you guys go rescue as many Paper Toads as possible?
I can't believe they'd just destroy our castle like that!
It's gonna take a whole lot of gold coins to pay for these repairs...
You know, this isn't exactly our first rodeo.
Who HASN'T been attacked by Bowser at this point?
What are you waiting for?
Oh! Maybe you don't know where to go.
Head through Gloomy Woods to get to Mount Brrr.
We can't let Bowser get away with this!
He could attack again at any moment!
But to stop him, we'd have to get to his castle.
Which is now flying hundreds of feet in the air...
Marios?
I have an idea!
Come in, come in!
I'd start by going to the top of Mount Brrr!
Oh! And I almost forgot. I've got something for Paper Mario.
You got a new Trio Attack, Trio Shuriken!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice using it!
This plan is pretty wild. But if anyone can pull it off, it's Toadette!
It's really something special. The Paper Toads and I have been hard at work on it.
I hope it comes in handy for you!
And you too, Luigi. Of course.
Anytime I say Mario, there's an implied Luigi. You should know that!
Please stay safe out there.
If you have questions about anything, don't forget to check your guide.
Paper Toads may look flimsy...but they can do great things when they team up!
So how did the experiment go?
Well, we're going to need a few dozen more Paper Toads...
But the early results are promising!
That's great news! A few dozen more would put us at...230 Paper Toads.
Thanks for the report!
Hey, what's all this about?
Oh, right! I haven't told you my idea yet. So...
Ahhhh! The sound of the waves and the feel of the sea breeze are so lovely.
It's like I'm on vacation and all that time we spent underground was just a terrible dream.
Yes! Here we are. This is the pipe that leads to the dungeon.
From there, we can sneak in the back door of Bowser's Castle!
All right, what are you waiting for? In we go!
Hey, just a second, guys!
Before we go down that pipe, you should double-check your gear.
We could even go back to the village and see if the shop has anything new.
Just think about it, OK? The village isn't far from here.
Where are we?
I wanna go back to Peach's Castle!
What's that? You need our help scoping out the area?
Well, I guess it's the least we can do for you.
Sure, we'll scope things out.
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
It sure is nice to see the sun after being locked away underground.
But where are we?
← Twinsy Tropics Toad Village
There's gotta be a Toad Village somewhere around here.
But I'm scared to go looking for it. This place is crawling with baddies!
This sunny paradise is a welcome change after all that toiling we did in the dark.
Thing is, it's so bright here, it's almost blinding.
I gotta be careful not to accidentally stumble into some of Bowser's minions!
This place is beautiful and everything, but how are we going to get home?
Don't tell me we have to swim... I didn't pack my bathing suit!

Welcome to the gear shop! How can I help you today?
You can access items like mushrooms through the menu.
Keeping your HP full at all times is key to success!
It's always a good idea to keep some Refreshing Herbs on hand!
When you feel out of sorts during a battle, that's the time to pop it out!
Not saying this will ever happen, but if your HP ever reaches 0 during a battle...
make sure someone else in your party gives you a 1-Up Mushroom!
Nuts are a communal food, so when you use them, all three of you get a boost!
When all three of you feel a little weak, eat some Nuts to regain HP!
I bet if you were playing on a New Nintendo 3DS, you could refill HP with  and BP with .
Oh! Um, I didn't see you there!
Don't mind me! I was just talking to myself!
I'm pretty sure all the info about refilling HP and BP is in the guide in the menu...

You should head to Doop Doop Dunes next!
Besides, shouldn't you head to the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto next?
Heading to Bowser's Castle, right?
Well, first you want to go to the bridge in East Doop Doop Dunes!
We can do more than merely help you rescue Paper Toads.
Once you clear a quest, it will be available for replay here!
We can use this paper trampoline to reach the two tall, spiky guys blocking the bridge.
Take a tip from a reporter... Always keep your eyes open!
Talk to everyone you can. Explore faraway places...
You never know what you'll find in the most unlikely location.
OK, let's head back to the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto.
Once we get there, we'll bust out the paper trampoline.
Instead of a delivery, this time I come bearing a message from Toadette!
I will read it for you.
Ahem!
"Paper Toads will pave the way to Neo Bowser Castle!"
"A stack of Paper Toads, leading to the sky!"
"For now, though, please head to the top of Mount Brrr."
"Oh, and don't stop rescuing Paper Toads."
"If you save enough of them, they'll make you another awesome Trio Attack."
And that was the message!
Would you like to hear it again?

Hi! Here to rescue some Paper Toads?
I can tell you guys are just itching to rescue some Paper Toads.
It's pretty big, so don't open it up in here!
There are no Paper Toad Rescue quests available for you right now.
For now, you should head over to the Goomba papercraft to meet Toadette!

I was just minding my own business when those monsters kidnapped me!
I would've been more scared if I wasn't just so darn surprised by the whole thing.
Rescue all the captured Paper Toads within the time limit!
You didn't save all the Paper Toads within the time limit!

Well, that was quite the harrowing experience!
Thank you so much for saving me!
Ahh, terra firma! It's so sweet, I could kiss it!
Walking truly is a wonderful thing, isn't it?
Wow, you guys sure know your way around a hammer.
I'm so impressed! Thank you!
Kidnapped by monsters... Whisked away by a sand flow...
Everything's such a mess! I want to go home!
Those monsters have nothing on you guys! You're my heroes!
Of all the Paper Toads out there, why did those monsters kidnap me?
It's all a mystery...
I was sure I was going to spend the rest of my life just flying around and around...
Boy, am I glad you guys showed up!
クエスト用ダミー
I was just about to make those monsters rue the day they kidnapped me.
So for their sake, it's a good thing you stepped in when you did!
You guys are so amazing! ...Can I have your autographs?
I don't want to seem uncool, but I AM a little starstruck.

AH HAHA!
Not bad... Not bad at all.
Though, of course, it would be much more intimidating if it looked more like me.
If you rounded out the bridge of the nose to more closely resemble mine—
Surely you're not calling ME ugly!
Your face looks like it got stuck in a panini press!

We could have had 'em if our papercraft weren't so ugly!
Let's go! We need to think of a new strategy!
Huh? B-but I didn't even know it was yours!
Here—take it! Just don't tell on me!
MAARRIOOOO!
We made a new papercraft too. And it's here right now!

Got the wind knocked out of your sails, didn't you?
Guess that's the end of them. Well, that was easy!
Our paper versions are probably just busy doing important stuff back home.
We don't really need their help anyway. The seven of us can handle stuff on our own.
Bowser's Castle is thataway!
OK, team! Let's forge ahead!
Oh, please, it's perfect! Because it looks just like me!
And why would I go out of my way to make it uglier?
All right, time to go throw this book in the garbage.
Sorry, but I can't hear anything through that big, floppy mouth of yours.
Huh huh huh!
And then we can hang out together and never be bored again!
OK, book, into the stinky garbage with you!
Ugh, them again! I thought we took care of those guys.
Right!
Hey, guys! We got a pickup for you!
On second thought...
Must you always have the last word?
Hold up! I just thought of something! Why aren't there any paper versions of us?
Let's keep this ugly garbage book for now. Who knows? Maybe it'll come in handy.
Like, if we get bored here, we could go terrorize YOUR world someday...
Was the "ugly" part really necessary?!
What is this? A book?
Guess those losers must've dropped it.
I wonder if it's important.
Nah, books are dumb.
Into the trash it goes!
Oh, hey there, squirt. And...uh...paper squirt.
Heh!
Roy! Wendy! Larry!
We gotta get these three to the secure location!
Yeah! Then I'll never have to go home!
It's stinky garbage time! It's stinky garbage time!
HOLD ON!
Don't you throw my book away! I'm gonna tell Dad on you!
Woo-hoo!
All right! Let's get this baby home!
Eeeeeeeek!
What is this crazy place? Where are all my friends?
I'm begging you, please don't eat me!
Wait, really? You're Mario? Like the famous Mario?
Eh, whatever! I'm finally safe!
I've asked the Toads to guard the exits so no Paper Toads slip by.
Please search the castle lobby, and find the Paper Toads who are hiding.
Rescue the Paper Toads!
Rescue the Paper Toads!
You rescued all of the Paper Toads!
Where could all the Paper Toads have gone? 
They're back inside the book. 
They were eaten by a goat. 
They might be closer than you think...
I don't believe they would have gone home without me.
A goat?! That's terrible!
...Oh, you're joking, aren't you? Tee hee. I guess that IS sort of funny.
I appreciate you trying to keep my spirits up in the midst of all this chaos!
Whatever do you mean?
I've been standing guard here, and I haven't let a single Paper Toad slip by!
My goodness! You picked quite the hiding spot, didn't you?
Ack! They found us! Run, everyone, run!
Good luck finding the rest of these guys, Mario and Luigi!
I have a feeling they won't make it easy on you.
Huh? Is that really Mario? Doesn't he look kind of round?
Eh, who cares? We're finally safe!
*zzz* *zzz*... Huh? Mario and Luigi?
You guys look weird. Like... rounder or something.
Oh, of course. I must be dreaming!
That would also explain why Luigi's looking so capable.
Whoa!
Ah! Are you, like, THE Mario?
I can't believe it's Mario! I was hiding because this world confused and terrified me.
But meeting you... I'm marginally less terrified!

But for now, please focus on finding those poor, flat guys.
Huh? You say you'll help us all get back home?
In that case, we'll stick with you. Got room in your pocket?
There's nothing here to look at! Just a boring old pillar...
...Fine! You got me!
I guess this is the end... Sniff... I'll end up torn into little pieces...
What do you mean, "look closer"?
Red and green ensembles... Bushy mustaches...
Omigosh! Mario and Luigi?! I'm getting rescued by celebrities!
The worst day of my life just turned into the best day of my life! 
Did Luigi mess something up again?
Is that why everyone's running around freaking out?
Skip QUEST CLEAR
Search this area very carefully. I know they're hiding here somewhere!
Please search this area for the hiding Paper Toads!
OOF!
Oh no, I'm caught! Please don't eat me! I'm pretty sure I taste horrible!
Has anyone ever told you that you look a lot like Mario?
What do you mean, you're the Mario from this world?
That's confusing, but I guess I have to trust you.
Please protect me, Princess Peach! Those burly brutes have it in for me!
Shhh... Calm down! They're Mario and Luigi.
They're here to rescue you.
Really?
I knew that! I was only pretending to hide.
Actually, I was keeping an eye on you, Princess!
I haven't seen any of those flat Toads at all.
I had no idea that one of them was under my feet this whole time...
You look different in real life. Stuffed... Like ravioli or something.

You found all the Paper Toads!
Boy, that was fun!
クエスト用ダミー
You Found All Toads Within the Given Time!
Right...but how did you sneak it in here? We're in Bowser's Castle, for crying out loud!
I...I think we have security and...stuff.
When?!
GRRR! You're answering my questions... without really telling me anything!
Gah! She's weirdly confident! It's making me even madder!
That...was pretty good. So good, in fact, that we're gonna have to kidnap you.
While you're sitting around crying, we'll be building the ultimate papercraft!
It's going to be tough but stylish... powerful but sophisticated...
And above all...better than the one you guys DON'T have! Eheeheehee!
So...think about THAT!
EHEEHEEHEE!
Bwahahaha! I'm gonna stomp 'em silly.
We finally made it...
Time to settle things once and for all!
Our number-one priority is saving the princesses from the Bowsers. Got it?
This is the scariest we could make it?
Huh? What's too bad?
Yeah, it would be more fun if they had a papercraft of their own that we could destroy!
Yeah, me too...
Yeah. That's super annoying.
Well, at least we'll get to test out OUR glorious papercraft.
Eheeheehee!
Good luck making any more papercrafts without your precious Toadette!
Say hello to the toughest and scariest papercraft of all time!
Well...
It's scary enough, OK? Look at those teeth!
I'm sure we're working on something scarier in the lab.
Anyway, it's not all about looks. This papercraft is fast, sleek, and deadly!
It's just too bad...
It's too bad we won't even need to use this thing to squash these guys.
Oh yeah, that'd be sweet.
Whoa! I can see it now!
No, I mean literally!
Wh...where did that come from?!

Heehee! All right, guys. Let's show 'em what this thing can do!

Oh. I built it here!
Just now.
You heard him, guys. Let's go!
Ahhhh! Leave me alone!
Mario! Help!
EHEEHEEHEE!
They have a new papercraft!
I wanted to thank you for saving my friends. That was fast!
They just joined up with me at the castle.
Dear Marios and Luigi...
I am one of the Paper Toads you rescued in Peach's Castle.
Let's pretend this never happened, OK?
All righty, here you go.
What's troubling you? 
I want to deal TONS of damage! 
There's this enemy I can't seem to beat. 
Nothing. I'm fine.
Come back anytime!
Come back anytime you want to talk more!
You bought a LV 1 ? Card!
You bought a LV 2 ? Card!
You sold a LV 1 ? Card for 200 coins!
You sold a LV 2 ? Card for 800 coins!
Unfortunately, you don't have enough coins.
? Cards are super valuable, so I can't just give them away. I hope you understand.
But you don't even have any LV 1 ? Cards!
Do you want to hear more about sparkle cards? 
No
Yes
But you don't even have any LV 2 ? Cards!
You're in the right place! What do you want to know? 
What exactly are sparkle cards? 
How do you get them? 
What's so awesome about them? 
Actually, I'm fine.
Sparkle cards are a rare breed of card that can't be purchased in stores!
They sparkle like diamonds, and they're equally precious!
Do you struggle with the same problems battle after battle?
If so, you came to the right Toad!
I've heard that some enemies drop sparkle cards when you defeat them...
But that almost sounds too good to be true! And I don't know which enemies drop them...
Sure, I can help you with that.
Besides being beautiful, sparkle cards use half the amount of Star Points.
This means you can use them more often in battle. Is that nifty or what?
If you're full on Star Points, don't be shy about using battle cards.
After all, you can't earn more points until you spend some of 'em!
What are you in the market for? 
I wanna buy! 
I wanna sell! 
Actually, never mind.
Did you see that card? It can increase the damage your attacks do to enemies.
There's just one thing—it also strengthens your enemies, so you'll TAKE more damage too!
I wouldn't use it if your HP is already low...
But if you're pretty good at dodging incoming attacks, I recommend this battle card highly!
We've all been there, haven't we? Well, the card I just showed you can help.
It can turn some of your opponents into easy-to-stomp Goombas!
Now, I know what you're thinking.
"If I turn my enemies into Goombas, am I gonna get Goomba-sized loot?"
Here's the beautiful part. You'll get the same loot you would have from the original enemy!
Let me guess... You want to talk about ? Cards, right?
All righty. These cards are very valuable, so I only sell them one at a time.
What would you like to do? 
Buy a LV 1 ? Card for 200 coins. 
Buy a LV 2 ? Card for 800 coins. 
Never mind.
All righty. These cards are very valuable, so I only buy them one at a time.
What would you like to do? 
Sell a LV 1 ? Card for 200 coins. 
Sell a LV 2 ? Card for 800 coins. 
Never mind.
I'll take a LV 1 ? Ca—
I'll take a LV 2 ? Ca—
I'll sell a LV 1 ? Card for 200—
I'll sell a LV 2 ? Card for 800—
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't go broadcasting that with a system message!
These ? Cards are rare and valuable. Keep it on the down low, bro!
LV 1 ? Cards full.
LV 2 ? Cards full.
Coins full.
Welcome to the card shop! How can I help you today?
Ah, well...this is awkward. You've been such a great customer...
So great, in fact, that I have nothing else to sell you!
I hope you're getting good use out of all those battle cards!
If you want to use more battle cards, make sure to use plenty of Bros. Attacks and Trio Attacks.
They'll help you earn Star Points the fastest!
Remember to add any new battle cards you buy to a battle card set.
Otherwise they won't show up in battle...when you most need 'em!
Don't you just love new battle cards? Ahh...that new battle card smell!
So, you want to hear about sparkle cards? 
Yes, please!
Nah, that's OK.
I was sure one of Bowser's minions was after me, so I ran as fast as I could.
Luckily, it was only you guys! Color me relieved!

Hmmm... It doesn't look like you can catch this Paper Toad at the moment.
One of the other Paper Toads might have an idea of how to snag him.
Try searching in a place you haven't searched yet.
Yeah! I was definitely getting a cramp in my hat. I mean...my head.
Huh? You say there's a Toad who's so fast you can't catch him?
Then maybe these will come in handy!
Oh! I almost forgot!
Before we go, let's get in a little practice on how to use the Dash Socks!
Try dashing through those Spinny Flowers behind you.
In order to bloom, those flowers need sun, water, and feet running over them. This is a weird place, all right.
Fantabulous!
The Spinny Flowers are in full bloom, thanks to your masterful dashing.
If you ever need a refresher on how to dash, just check out the guide.

Paper Toads are pretty fast on their own but slow down when they stack up...
Push them together and force them to stack up!
I've got an idea!

Hey, guys! Feel free to hang around in here for a while if you need to warm up!
We don't have a heater or a fire or anything, but at least there's no wind in here...
You should head to Doop Doop Dunes next!
Besides, shouldn't you head to the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto next?
Heading to Bowser's Castle, right?
Well, first you want to go to the bridge in East Doop Doop Dunes!
Looking for a place to kick back and unwind?
Then head to that pipe on the left. It'll take you to a magical place!
If you're not sure where to go next, talk to the desk attendant on the right!
He'll tell you if there are any Paper Toads who need rescuing.
We can use this paper trampoline to reach the two tall, spiky guys blocking the bridge.
OK, let's head back to the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto.
Once we get there, we'll bust out the paper trampoline.
Instead of a delivery, this time I come bearing a message from Toadette!
I will read it for you.
Ahem!
"Paper Toads will pave the way to Neo Bowser Castle!"
"A stack of Paper Toads, leading to the sky!"
"For now, though, please head to the top of Mount Brrr."
"Oh, and don't stop rescuing Paper Toads."
"If you save enough of them, they'll make you another awesome Trio Attack."
And that was the message!
Would you like to hear it again? 
No
Yes
This pipe is off limits for the time being because it connects to—
Whoops! I almost slipped some top-secret info there! Good thing I caught myself!
Please check again later.

Certificate of Commendation
You have exhibited extreme skill and dedication by clearing all possible quests.
On behalf of the entire network of Lakitu Info Centers, we offer our heartiest congratulations!
Want to revisit a quest that you've already played? Then you're in the right place!
You should head to the dock next!
You should head to Peach's Castle next!
Today's Challenge
Do you have what it takes to meet today's challenge and earn a special reward?
You'll need to clear  or more quests!
To reach that number, you'll have to try some quests in Hard Mode. Good luck!
If you're heading to Mount Brrr, you'll need to pass through the rest of Gloomy Woods first.

Toadette said to keep after the princesses!
You'll want to head east from here, so take the exit to the right. Good luck!
I hear Twinsy Tropics is a lovely place to kick back and relax.
To get there, head southeast from Doop Doop Dunes!
Headed to Bowser's Castle?
I heard a rumor that you can get there from the dungeon under Twinsy Tropics.
Looks like you've saved every Paper Toad! Nice work!
Now it's time to face off with the Bowsers for your final challenge!
Delivery Toad here, direct from Peach's Castle!
We've transported the Paper Toads you rescued to the workshop in Peach's Castle.
Here you go!
When we left them, they were hard at work with Toadette on some mysterious construction project.
The whole scene was a little chaotic, to be honest...
I peeked inside already, and it's a new Trio Attack!
And here's one more package for you.
You got a new Trio Attack, Trio Kite!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice using it!
You got a new Trio Attack, Trio Whirligig!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice using it!
You got a new Trio Attack, Trio Meteor!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice using it!
You got a paper trampoline!
It's too big to set up here. Set it up later when you need to use it!
Well then, I'm off!
All right! Don't forget to save, OK?
Would you like to revisit a quest you've already played?
You can test your skills by playing the quest in Hard Mode!
Hi! Here to rescue some Paper Toads?
I can tell you guys are just itching to rescue some Paper Toads.
It's pretty big, so don't open it up in here!
There are no Paper Toad Rescue quests available for you right now.
For now, you should head over to the Goomba papercraft to meet Toadette!
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
This delicious Lakitea refreshes body and mind for a mere  coins.
Would you like to purchase some Lakitea? 
No
Yes
Your HP and BP have been fully restored!　
Oh, I'm sorry, but you don't have enough coins.
This is the Battle Ring, where you fight all sorts of fierce bosses.
And here you'll go head to head against papercraft bosses!
Finally, we have the Attackathon section, where you try for high scores using Bros. and Trio Attacks.
When you get a high rating or high score in any of these games...
you earn points that you can redeem for exclusive gear in the gear shop.
Enter the Boss Battle Ring? 
No
Yes
Enter the Papercraft Battle Ring? 
No
Yes
Play Attackathon? 
No
Yes
Ahhh! It's so relaxing up here. I might just take a little nap.
It's important to take some time away from the hustle and bustle of work to just kick back.
Some people like cream and sugar in their Lakitea, but why mess with perfection?
I'm taking a break to recharge before I head back into the Battle Ring.
I need to figure out what to do about that one Petey Piranha attack...
Do you have a favorite Bros. or Trio Attack?
Test your skills at the Attackathon station!
You can try your hand at 3 different game modes here.

I need to deliver  of them... Can you help me out?
What is wrong with me today? I just can't keep the mushrooms in the bag!
How will I ever deliver  of them at this rate?
Well, this is just ridiculous.
As soon as I deliver my  mushrooms, I am taking the rest of the day off!
Where are you going? This is the wrong way!
Pick up all the mushrooms that clumsy Toad dropped!
You picked them all up for me? Thank you, guys! You're the best!
Now I've got to hurry off. I'll be more careful this time!
I was worried that my "mushrooms delivered in an hour or they're free" offer was going to backfire...

I was here reporting on something else originally, but who cares about that now!
NO?! You won't help? Well, this is an even bigger story than I thought!

You should head to Doop Doop Dunes next!
This just in! Multiple Chain Chomps have escaped! I'm following up on that story!
Besides, shouldn't you head to the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto next?
Don't get too close to them!
Heading to Bowser's Castle, right?
Well, first you want to go to the bridge in East Doop Doop Dunes!
Welcome, Mario and company.
Speaking of them, can you give us some information on where to find other Paper Toads?
It sounds like they're going to be pretty key in defeating the Bowsers.
We'd be willing to compensate you for your help, of course.
If it's information you're after, you've come to the right place!
Let's talk business, shall we?
If we factor in the costs we've incurred up to now...
and estimate the costs of future Paper Toad location... Ah, yes.
So that'll be 10 coins!
Here we are. That would fall under the Premium Toad Location Plan. Which will be 5,000 coins.
Hmm... You're a tough negotiator, aren't you?
Hmmm... Fine then.
I'll tell you about the Paper Toads for free...
Paper Toads will help you move forward with your mission, but first you'll have to round them up.
We can use this paper trampoline to reach the two tall, spiky guys blocking the bridge.
OK, let's head back to the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto.
Once we get there, we'll bust out the paper trampoline.

Oh, hello! I've been tasked by Princess Peach to assist you all in your journey.
If you don't mind, I'm going to make some notes about our conversation to send back to her.
But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. We haven't even been properly introduced!
I am a Lakitu. Pleased to meet you!
As I mentioned, Princess Peach has asked me to look out for you and provide assistance as necessary.
So I was just working on my report to her.
If you need me, rest assured that I will dash over to your side.
But for now, I will keep a respectful distance.
One last thing: Be sure to save often, won't you?
If you happen to exit your adventure without saving, you'll restart from a previous save point.
And nobody wants that!
I don't think this is the way to Peach's Castle...
To save, simply tap SAVE on the Touch Screen.
Welcome back, guys... It's been a while!
Have you been checking out the guide regularly? There's some good stuff in there...
I mean, it can't do your homework or chores for you...but it might just help you win a tough battle!
Our course is clear. Let's head to Mount Brrr!
To get to Mount Brrr, cut through the north part of Gloomy Woods.
You must hurry!
The fate of the worlds is in your hands!
Not to mention the princesses!
Uh, right, anyway...
You're gonna need a papercraft, which I will take care of.
You guys go ahead to Mount Brrr, and I'll meet you there!
No worries, green dude!
I've been on all sorts of adventures recently, so I'm actually kind of an expert on this.
See you at Mount Brrr!
"Their willingness to engage in conversation suggests a tendency toward extroversion."
"While generally a positive, they should exercise caution when meeting strangers."
"Sometimes it's important to be wary of others!"
If you're headed to Mount Brrr, you're going to have to go through Gloomy Woods, I'm afraid.
"The subjects appear focused on the adventure ahead."
"So focused, in fact, that they nearly ran by this reporter without any acknowledgment."
"The subjects appear focused on the adventure ahead."
For example, if you don't know where to go...
Just open up the guide and check out the map!
"This focus will surely come in handy for the battles ahead."
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
Fear not, beloved princess!
This Toad will never abandon you!
Oh, right, I almost forgot...
I heard that the shops in Peach's Castle have new inventory, so we should check them out!
Just keep going this way, and then head north. Good luck!

Let's pretend this never happened, OK?
So, when you use the card I just showed, you and your companions will take 0 damage for 2 attacks.
All righty, here you go.
It doesn't matter how strong your opponents are or what kinds of attacks they use...
When this card is in play, none of your crew will take any damage from 2 attacks in a row!
Try using it when you come up against a particularly tricky boss!
Come back anytime!
Come back anytime you want to talk more!
The card I just showed you weakens an enemy's defense so your attacks pack more punch!
You bought a LV 1 ? Card!
Try using it in combination with a card that raises your attack power for a real one-two punch!
You bought a LV 2 ? Card!
You sold a LV 1 ? Card for 200 coins!
You sold a LV 2 ? Card for 800 coins!
Unfortunately, you don't have enough coins.
? Cards are super valuable, so I can't just give them away. I hope you understand.
But you don't even have any LV 1 ? Cards!
Do you want to hear more about sparkle cards? 
No
Yes
But you don't even have any LV 2 ? Cards!
You're in the right place! What do you want to know? 
What exactly are sparkle cards? 
How do you get them? 
What's so awesome about them? 
Actually, I'm fine.
Sparkle cards are a rare breed of card that can't be purchased in stores!
They sparkle like diamonds, and they're equally precious!
Do you struggle with the same problems battle after battle?
If so, you came to the right Toad!
I've heard that some enemies drop sparkle cards when you defeat them...
But that almost sounds too good to be true! And I don't know which enemies drop them...
Sure, I can help you with that.
Besides being beautiful, sparkle cards use half the amount of Star Points.
This means you can use them more often in battle. Is that nifty or what?
What's troubling you? 
I want to reduce the damage I take. 
I want to deal lots more damage! 
Nothing. I'm fine.
What are you in the market for? 
I wanna buy! 
I wanna sell! 
Actually, never mind.
Let me guess... You want to talk about ? Cards, right?
Have you guys been using your battle cards much?
Don't think of them as mere cards. Those things are powerful weapons!
All righty. These cards are very valuable, so I only sell them one at a time.
What would you like to do? 
Buy a LV 1 ? Card for 200 coins. 
Buy a LV 2 ? Card for 800 coins. 
Never mind.
All righty. These cards are very valuable, so I only buy them one at a time.
What would you like to do? 
Sell a LV 1 ? Card for 200 coins.

Never mind.
I'll take a LV 1 ? Ca—
I'll take a LV 2 ? Ca—
I'll sell a LV 1 ? Card for 200—
I'll sell a LV 2 ? Card for 800—
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't go broadcasting that with a system message!
These ? Cards are rare and valuable. Keep it on the down low, bro!
Next time you're in a tight spot, bust out one of those battle cards!
And then you can come back here and thank me for the advice.
LV 1 ? Cards full.
LV 2 ? Cards full.
Coins full.
Welcome to the card shop! How can I help you today?
Ah, well...this is awkward. You've been such a great customer...
So great, in fact, that I have nothing else to sell you!
I hope you're getting good use out of all those battle cards!
So, you want to hear about sparkle cards? 
Yes, please!
Nah, that's OK.
Wait, one of them was hiding in here the whole time? I better get my eyes checked!
I hear the village is absolutely packed with Paper Toads right now!
That said, I haven't seen any in the shop. Sorry about that.
I do occasionally hear a bit of rustling around the shop. But it's probably just a ghost.
Wait...what am I saying? Now I'm scared!
So it was a Paper Toad making that noise the whole time? Whew!
I'm so glad the place isn't haunted.
Paper Toads? In THIS shop? Nah. Haven't seen any.

There was a sign that said employees only, but I was kind of in a pinch...

Bowser AGAIN? Can you believe this guy?
Oh, one more thing while you're here...
I hear some pretty strange noises coming from the top of the mountain sometimes.
Just thought you should know.
Help the Toad? 
No
Yes
Man...I just can't wrap my head around it...
Oh! Mario! Luigi! Paper...Mario? Whatever. Good to see you guys!
Say, maybe you can help me out...
I was up here doing research, and I discovered something pretty strange.
Will you help me figure out what's going on here? I can even offer you a small reward...
You got a Blunt Hammer DX!
Did you get turned around?
If you want to reach the summit, head back the other direction!
Trying to get all the way to the top? You'll have to go back the other direction!
Go all the way to the west before you try to go up. That's how you reach the summit!
I'd loan you my cloud, but I'm not sure it can handle the three of you. Good luck!
Well, that's OK, I guess. I'll just keep on researching by myself up here, in the cold...
Yes! I knew I could count on you.
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
What'd you find, Luigi?
Whoa!
Yep, it looks like they really don't want anyone opening that door.
Still...there must be a way in. Let's go find it!
You did it! Man! That thing has been driving me crazy for years.
Here. This is the least I can do!
I guess I can go home now...but I've been up here so long, I've forgotten how to climb down.

You should head to Doop Doop Dunes next!
Besides, shouldn't you head to the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto next?
Heading to Bowser's Castle, right?
Well, first you want to go to the bridge in East Doop Doop Dunes!
We can use this paper trampoline to reach the two tall, spiky guys blocking the bridge.
OK, let's head back to the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto.
Once we get there, we'll bust out the paper trampoline.
Instead of a delivery, this time I come bearing a message from Toadette!
I will read it for you.
Ahem!
"Paper Toads will pave the way to Neo Bowser Castle!"
"A stack of Paper Toads, leading to the sky!"
"For now, though, please head to the top of Mount Brrr."
"Oh, and don't stop rescuing Paper Toads."
"If you save enough of them, they'll make you another awesome Trio Attack."
And that was the message!
Would you like to hear it again? 
No
Yes
This pipe is off limits for the time being because it connects to—
Whoops! I almost slipped some top-secret info there! Good thing I caught myself!
Please check again later.

Don't think of this as us getting revenge for the last time we tangled...
Think of it as a whole new beatdown! We've got some new tricks under our shells!
We may have lost to you twice... but we can do better!
Just wait until our third, fourth, or fifth fight... Then you'll see...
Gah! They're so stubborn!
GRR! My hatred for Mario burns brighter than a thousand stars!
GRRR! Must we do everything?
Whatever. I'm not impressed!
Time for a real leader to step to the plate!
No. If anything, we're a republic... Wait, what am I saying?
WHO CARES? GET MARIO!
I...I've been dethroned...
Well done, guys! I think you just took out every one of Bowser's minions!
But there's still the small matter of Bowser himself...not to mention Paper Bowser!
Are you ready?
I thought we were operating as a collective trust!
That's the spirit!
Pfft. No problem!
What should we be afraid of? We have two Marios! And one Luigi, of course...
Yeah! So now they're probably tired!
All right, let's go!
Forgive us...but DESTROY them!
You heard him! We're here to stop you for good!
OK, now I know I gave you an awesome pep talk, but this is your last chance to prepare.
Are you ready to take on the Bowsers? 
No
Yes
It's go time!
Great! Let's do it!
In the end...I regret...everything.
No problem. Heal yourself, stock up on items, and come back when you're ready!
Fine! But I'm doing it of my own free will, not because you're some kind of leader...
Wait...now you think of yourself as KING? Oh, forget it...
Yeah, we never voted on anything like that.
Um... So it's down to just us...
You...you did just see what they did to everyone else, right?
Forgive us...Bowser. I mean... Master Bowser...
Are...are you talking about yourself?
Yeah! Let me at 'em!
Haha! You're right!
Let's smash 'em while they're tired!
Yeah...avenge us, Master Bowser!
Hmm...sending lots of minions doesn't seem to be doing the trick.
Although...maybe the answer is even MORE minions...
KEEP 'EM COMING, GUYS!
Yes. They're the worst, aren't they?
Yeah? Well, my hatred for him burns brighter than a BILLION stars!
All right, that's it!
Koopalings! End this...NOW!
Thanks for your patronage!
Come back anytime you want to talk more!
Do you want to hear more about sparkle cards? 
No
Yes
You're in the right place! What do you want to know? 
What exactly are sparkle cards? 
How do you get them? 
What's so awesome about them? 
Actually, I'm fine.
Sparkle cards are a rare breed of card that can't be purchased in stores!
They sparkle like diamonds, and they're equally precious!
Do you struggle with the same problems battle after battle?
If so, you came to the right Toad!
I've heard that some enemies drop sparkle cards when you defeat them...
But that almost sounds too good to be true! And I don't know which enemies drop them...
Sure, I can help you with that.
Besides being beautiful, sparkle cards use half the amount of Star Points.
This means you can use them more often in battle. Is that nifty or what?
I hear that if you use a solo attack against a paper enemy, you can sometimes crumple it!
It makes me feel a little bad for those paper enemies, to be honest...
The eternal question. Should you re-up Paper Mario's copies or do a Trio Attack?
Well, this is the card that says, "Why not both?"
Yes, with this fine battle card, you can refill Paper Mario's copies to the max.
Then simply select your favorite Trio Attack and go to town!
Some might say that's simply asking too much. But I disagree!
With this battle card, you can recover HP each time you're attacked!
You'll actually be happy to be attacked! What a concept!
Now, it's a bit pricey. But I think you'll find it's worth every single gold coin.
Oh dear... The details of this battle card are still a secret!
Hee hee hee! I'm sure I've piqued your curiosity, but please ask about it later!
Um... I'd love to welcome you to my shop, but it's actually not open yet.
Due to incredible demand, we're totally sold out of cards!
Thank you for purchasing so many!
What's troubling you? 
I want more copies of Paper Mario! 
I want to recover without using items. 
Nothing. I'm fine.
Hey, I've got a hot tip for you!
If you clear all the Battle Challenges, you receive a very special piece of gear!
Pretty exciting, right?
So, you want to hear about sparkle cards? 
Yes, please!
Nah, that's OK.
Mushrooms will recover lost HP.
If you're feeling weak, go to the Items section in the menu and grab a mushroom.
Whenever you do a Bros. Attack, you use BP.
If your BP gets low, you can replenish it with a yummy, yummy Syrup Jar.
Welcome to the item shop!
Welcome to the gear shop!
Welcome to the card shop!
You found all of the Paper Toads!

Supposedly this is all related to the new paper terrain that's been popping up everywhere.
Ooh, I hope I can be the one to break this story wide open...
Whoa, Mario! Fancy meeting you here.
I'm here to research the summit of Mount Brrr.
People think this is where all that new paper terrain is coming from.
Someone tipped us off about suspicious activity on the summit, so we're up here investigating.
I'm just an intern, though, so I don't have any more details.
It's a dead end over there, I'm afraid.
I did see a Toad wandering around, though. Maybe he knows something.
Pardon me for one moment.
Hey, you! Over there! Any movement?
No, sir! Nothing in particular. But I'll keep my eyes peeled!
Well, I wouldn't expect it to be easy to crack this case.
You've got to have gumption, moxie, and stick-to-itiveness.
And you've got to give 110%! Am I right?
Come to think of it, that Toad seemed awfully anxious...

How's the item we created for you? Hope it's being useful!
If we had more helpers, we could make even more amazing things!
We're counting on you to find Nabbit and take back the Bros. Attacks he stole from us!
Oh and also to save the world and all that jazz.
You got a new Bros. Attack, 3D Red Shell!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice using it!
This papercraft is made of the strongest, most durable stuff out there!
You got a new Bros. Attack, Fire Flower!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice using it!
That's why it's—oof—so heavy!
So let's get it built and show those knuckleheads who's boss!
It's nice to practice a new attack before you have to use it for real in battle.
Or so I hear. I'm actually not much of a fighter myself.
Where'd the desk guy go?
The Paper Toads are resting in the workshop in the back. It's been a crazy day for them.
We're all feeling a bit calmer now. Sorry for all the ruckus back there.
From here on out, my friends and I will be brainstorming ways to help out!
You have to be assertive with blocks. When you see one, jump up and hit it!
So please take these with you.
As our way of saying thanks for the help...
we made you something to use in battle! We hope you like it.
Sincerely, the Paper Toads
STOP!
Aw, man...
This thing is so heavy! Where am I supposed to put it?
That guy just stole a whole bunch of Bros. Attacks!
A smidge to the right.
Without those, we're doomed!
It's all over for me, for you, for this kingdom, and for this game too!
Hoo... Hoo... Hwah... Done!
IT'S GAME OVER FOR US ALL!
I said a smidge, not a scooch!
Huh? You really think you can make do with just these two?
OK, move it a tad to the left!
Well, you guys ARE the heroes...
But, Toadette, now I'm back where I started!
Aw, that's awfully nice of you to say.
Ugh, never mind. I'll do it myself! Give me that!
Hmph, you call this heavy, noodle arms?
We're so touched!
Listen, if you want to achieve greatness, you have to be willing to work for it!
Just a few more tweaks, and my masterpiece will be complete!
There are voices coming from the other side of the door...
If there were more of us Paper Toads, we'd be able to build it for sure!
Are you talking about what I think you're talking about?
It wouldn't be easy, but with more of us, we might be able to pull it off.

Nabbit stole your hammers! Go get them back!
You've now recovered all the hammers that Nabbit stole!
You feel that draft?
There's a hole somewhere in the wall, and it's letting in cold air. Brrr!
Hmm... Is it coming from over here?
Don't be scared, Luigi!
What's that? You're scared of the dark?
Hmm. I see what you mean... It is a little creepy in here.
I opened the curtains! All better?
All right then. Where is that draft coming from?
Aha! There it is!
It's pretty high up... And my legs are pretty short...
I don't think I can reach it by myself.
Um...
Stop messing around!
Can you please see if that's where the draft is coming from?
HEEELP!
Augh!
You know it's right behind you, right?
Ow ow ow!
Snap out of it, Luigi! That book is doing something weird!
I can't believe what I'm seeing!
Oh, you'll go check it out?
Thanks, Luigi!
Where are you going?
You said you would check out that hole in the wall!
Finish what you started!
Stop shirking your duties!
Um, Luigi...
Please go check out the hole in the wall!
To get to it, you can jump onto the shelves.
What's that? A mouse? I must've missed it.
Anyway, you're not scared of a little mouse, are you?
Please finish checking out the hole in the wall.

Or you can tap the hammer icon on the lower screen.
Let's pretend this never happened, OK?
All righty, here you go.
Come back anytime!
Come back anytime you want to talk more!
You bought a LV 1 ? Card!
You bought a LV 2 ? Card!
You sold a LV 1 ? Card for 200 coins!
You sold a LV 2 ? Card for 800 coins!
Unfortunately, you don't have enough coins.
? Cards are super valuable, so I can't just give them away. I hope you understand.
But you don't even have any LV 1 ? Cards!
Do you want to hear more about sparkle cards? 
No
Yes
But you don't even have any LV 2 ? Cards!
Oh. Um...hello.
I suppose you, uh, wanna buy something?
No pressure, of course! It's OK if you just want to, um, stand there awkwardly...
You're in the right place! What do you want to know? 
What exactly are sparkle cards? 
How do you get them? 
What's so awesome about them? 
Actually, I'm fine.
I sell...um...battle cards...
Oh dear. I'm afraid I'm fresh out of battle cards...
It's just that...you bought so many already...
Please don't talk to me... Please don't talk to me... Oh! I mean...hello.
Sorry, but I'm not really open right now. Can you just, like, come back later? Or not?
Sparkle cards are a rare breed of card that can't be purchased in stores!
They sparkle like diamonds, and they're equally precious!
Do you struggle with the same problems battle after battle?
If so, you came to the right Toad!
I've heard that some enemies drop sparkle cards when you defeat them...
But that almost sounds too good to be true! And I don't know which enemies drop them...
Sure, I can help you with that.
Besides being beautiful, sparkle cards use half the amount of Star Points.
This means you can use them more often in battle. Is that nifty or what?
Welcome, welcome...
...to the best gear shop in the woooooorld!
Well, some battle cards are meant to be used against specific types of enemies.
So be sure you're using a card that's effective against the type of enemy you're facing!
We cut out the middletoad to sell to you for LESS! Now, what can I do you for?
This battle card, for example, deals damage to all enemies with shells.
Since many of Bowser's minions wear shells, it can be pretty useful!
HAHAHAHA!
Those are called ? Cards, and while they're not used in battle, they are very useful!
For instance, you can use an amiibo to transform a ? Card into a character card!
Welcome to the gear shop!
It's rumored that enemies sometimes drop ? Cards in defeat, but I haven't seen it happen.
It's also rumored that you can buy them on the black market from a Toad somewhere...

What's troubling you? 
I'm having a hard time with certain enemies. 
What's the deal with the question mark cards? 
Nothing. I'm fine.
What are you in the market for? 
I wanna buy! 
I wanna sell! 
Actually, never mind.
Let me guess... You want to talk about ? Cards, right?
All righty. These cards are very valuable, so I only sell them one at a time.
What would you like to do? 
Buy a LV 1 ? Card for 200 coins. 
Buy a LV 2 ? Card for 800 coins. 
Never mind.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't go broadcasting that with a system message!
These ? Cards are rare and valuable. Keep it on the down low, bro!
Hey, guys, what kind of gear have you been using lately?
You HAVE been equipping new gear from time to time, right?
You can't just buy it and forget about it. Gear up, guys!
LV 1 ? Cards full.
LV 2 ? Cards full.
Coins full.
Welcome! We sell all kinds of items. What are you looking for today?
We have quite a range of personalities here in the village shop.
Me? I'm the neutral one. Someone has to actually work.
So, you want to hear about sparkle cards? 
Yes, please!
Nah, that's OK.
Oh, of course...
← Peach's Castle
Wowzers!
So this is what your home world looks like?
So all these paper trees and stuff must have flown out of the book too!
Then how did all this get here?
We have Bowser to thank for this entire mess!
This delicious Lakitea refreshes body and mind for a mere  coins.
Would you like to purchase some Lakitea? 
No
Yes
Your HP and BP have been fully restored!　
Oh, I'm sorry, but you don't have enough coins.
This is the Battle Ring, where you fight all sorts of fierce bosses.
And here you'll go head to head against papercraft bosses!
Finally, we have the Attackathon section, where you try for high scores using Bros. and Trio Attacks.
When you get a high rating or high score in any of these games...
you earn points that you can redeem for exclusive gear in the gear shop.
Enter the Boss Battle Ring? 
No
Yes
Enter the Papercraft Battle Ring? 
No
Yes
Play Attackathon? 
No
Yes
Ahhh! It's so relaxing up here. I might just take a little nap.
It's important to take some time away from the hustle and bustle of work to just kick back.
Some people like cream and sugar in their Lakitea, but why mess with perfection?
I'm taking a break to recharge before I head back into the Battle Ring.
I need to figure out what to do about that one Petey Piranha attack...
Do you have a favorite Bros. or Trio Attack?
Test your skills at the Attackathon station!
You can try your hand at 3 different game modes here.

It has lots of interchangeable parts, so it's super versatile.
And it only took me three hours to build!
Wait!
Whew! We caught you just in time!
We have something for you to take on your journey!
FEVSE_ITEM_GETを もらった！(90)
You got the Copy Block!
I wanted to thank you for saving my friends. That was fast!
They just joined up with me at the castle.
We actually made this Copy Block ourselves.
We think you'll find it pretty useful!
Wait a sec! There's one last thing I need to tell you!
A Copy Block? Why didn't I think of that?
In the course of your adventure, if you ever find yourself not knowing where to go...
you should consult the guide map on the lower screen and find the arrow!
Thanks! That back room has all kinds of cool stuff that I've never seen before!
We took the liberty of using some of it to make that Copy Block.
We're a pretty crafty bunch, so we're planning on making stuff out of paper too!
I think you're gonna like what we come up with!
...And he disappeared.
Paper, eh? How intriguing!
Huh... I could have sworn I saw one of them right here.
Well then, good luck out there!
With my brain and these guys' dexterity... Well, the possibilities are very exciting!
That's it! Juuuump!
Well then, we'd better get back to work.
Good luck on your journey, Mario and Luigi!
I can just picture the sorry scene now.
The two princesses, distraught with fear... Shivering in the cold...
Their frozen tears like ice drops on their faces...
You should definitely stop by and take a look before you head out again!
Oh, hi there!
That hateful Bowser!
Look at what I made!
It's what I call a "papercraft"!
Can you believe that creep has a villa?!
It's true. Sometimes my genius frightens even me.
My next project is gonna be a life-sized papercraft for you guys!
It might be more of a help to you than Luigi!
I'm just kidding, of course!
The west side of Gloomy Woods is a totally different story, though.
I wouldn't want to go there alone! It's pitch black, day and night!
Good luck on your adventure!
I wish I could go with you... I'm actually getting pretty good at this adventuring thing.
While the bratty Bowser Jrs. whine endlessly about feeling bored...
They're at Mount Brrr!
A fate worse than death!
This cannot stand!
♪ Muuuushrooom deliveryyyy! 
Have you ever used a Boo Biscuit during a battle?
It makes you invisible for a while and prevents an enemy from hurting you.
The trade-off is that you can't attack until it wears off.
Oh, hello there, fellows!
My biceps have gotten so much stronger since starting this delivery route.
Lugging this sack of mushrooms around all day is serious exercise!
Now, let me just make sure I have the right number of mushrooms...
10... 20... 30... Uh-oh, what's this?
I seem to be one regular mushroom short. My manager is going to freak out!
What's that, Mario? You'll give me that one?
Ah, Mario! I'm glad I caught you before you left.
We have some special Bros. Attacks for you and Luigi!
Thank you so much!
Now I can finish making this delivery!
I think you'll find Bros. Attacks extremely handy when dealing with Bowser's minions.
So don't forget 'em, OK? Stop by the room to your left to pick 'em up when you're ready.
Here—I've got a special mushroom you can have. Just a small token of my appreciation.
You got a 1-Up Mushroom!
Luigi.
Apparently they give you lots of EXP and coins if you defeat them!
Good thing I'm an indoor Toad. Those shiny enemies sound awful!
I'm going to check out what they're cooking up.
Who knows? Maybe we'll end up collaborating on something amazing!
Dear Marios and Luigi...
I am one of the Paper Toads you rescued in Peach's Castle.
You can even zoom in and out by giving it a tap. It's super handy!
I heard there are shiny versions of paper monsters that are super tough to beat.
Oh, it's awful! Just awful!
What are we going to do?! What are we going to DO?!
Hey, flat Toads! You can stop hiding now!
Get a grip on yourself!
Gloomy Woods is due north of Sunbeam Plains.
The east side of Gloomy Woods is super cozy, and sunshine filters through the leaves.
Come on out! There's no reason to be scared!
My friend here is too distraught to speak clearly, so let me explain the situation.
Please listen carefully. None of this fast-forwarding business, OK?
I see one of them over there!
There I was, taking my daily constitutional up Mount Brrr...
We're here to help, guys!
When suddenly, who should appear but Bowser Jr. and Paper Bowser Jr.!
With both princesses in tow!
Boy, am I glad to see you two!
Which means that the princesses aren't at Bowser's Castle anymore...
The Paper Toads are scared and hiding.
If I could just talk to them, I'm sure I could calm them down.
Thing is, they're so flat that they just disappear right into the scenery...
So the princesses aren't being held at Bowser's Castle anymore...
Mario.
That's right. They're now at Bowser's Villa way up at the top of Mount Brrr!
Let's find the Paper Toads that are hiding in the castle first.
Bowser's treachery is even greater than we previously imagined.
I appreciate your help. Those poor, scared Toads...
So please show yourselves already!
The only ones who can save the princesses now are...
Hey, where'd you guys go?
Do you ever find it embarrassing to ask for directions?
Well, no need to worry about that.
If you get lost, you can check the map on the bottom screen.
Oh, hey. You have a guide, right?
If you have any questions about how to do stuff, give it a quick peek.
To access the guide, just tap MENU on the lower screen.
So we've got flat Toads who exploded out of a book. It's like some sort of crazy dream.
Anyway, they're hanging out in the workshop now, which is the back part of the room to the west.
Oh, are you headed out already?
Listen, before you go, you should stock up at the shops next door.
You'll be glad you did!
It might get a little hairy out there, but we'll all be rooting for you!
We'll be rooting from the safety of this castle, but rooting nonetheless.
FEVSE_ITEM_GET_Lを もらった！(240)
We Toads have taken an oath to protect the princess at any cost.
However, fighting isn't exactly our specialty, so please hurry back.
The shops have all kinds of new goodies available for sale.

It's possible that the Paper Toads are hiding in fear of Bowser's minions.
Or...they might just be really into hide-and-seek. It's inconclusive.
Well, to be fair, there's always plenty of paper circulating around here in the Info Center.
It would be pretty easy for a Paper Toad to get shuffled into the mix!

Hello, Mario!
You...you want to inspect my cloud? Well, this is highly unusual. But...OK.
Yes, we're in the information business...
But we don't have any info on where those Paper Toads could be hiding!

You may have passed my test...
...but there's 1 more know-it-all Toad out there waiting for a challenge!
You'll find know-it-all Toads in all corners of the world...
Pass all of their quizzes to win something really cool!
Now, don't go resting on your laurels. There are more challenges to conquer!
Visit one of the Lakitu Info Centers and go from there...
That reminds me. There's something you can do to help US out.
I can't believe it... You passed ALL of the know-it-all Toads' tests?
Do you think you could make us something to help us jump really high?
Toads made out of paper... Man... Now I really have seen everything.
That's amazing! I never thought I'd see the day...
Well, fair's fair, so here's your reward. Enjoy!
Yes. REALLY high...
Did you hear? Bowser captured a bunch of Toads and has been making them work on his castle!
How awful! You've got to rescue them, Mario!
So Bowser wants to take over the world. I guess he's entitled to his ambition...
But he should have done it the proper way! You know, filed all the right paperwork and stuff.
Oh well. Come back when you feel like having a brain battle, OK?
Want to give it a shot? 
No
Yes
I've transported the Paper Toads safely to the workshop in Peach's Castle.
And as for your request for something that will let you jump really high...
The Paper Toads have informed me that they require 8 more helpers to finish the job.
So you know what you have to do!
Is it just me, or is it hot out here?
It's hot, right? Are you hot?
Did I mention how hot it is? Yeesh!
Whew, you really helped us out there!
Ugh, this heat! I'm sautéing out here!
Maybe I'll go for a swim in Twinsy Tropics. It's not far from here!
Hmm... Something to jump really high with?
Hey, have you seen that weird cloud up there in the sky?
Are you serious? It's Bowser's Castle? Gah! I can't believe it!
I wish you hadn't told me! I was so much happier with a weird cloud...
I'm not going to get mad... I'm going to get smarter!
I'm so scared...
Boy, did I underestimate you! You've got brawn and brains.
I guess that's why you're the heroes!
Well, I guess I'll just...do it myself. As soon as I get, like, 400 times faster...
You got everything back for us. Thanks again, Mario!
Thank you so much!
You should probably hang on to that Bros. Attack. You've got more use for it than I do!
Oh, are you on your way to Twinsy Tropics?
Don't let me hold you up! Be careful out there.
Hey, Mario, have you been using Trio Hammer much? It's pretty useful!
You can flip things over—or stop other things from moving... Get crazy with it!
You got Mushroom Gloves!
Have you seen these new paper platforms everywhere?
Someone told me that Kamek is behind it...
Of course, it's not all bad.
I heard that some of the platforms made a new bridge to Twinsy Tropics!
Yeah, yeah, so Bowser made a giant castle fly. I'm not impressed.
I don't even know why he bothers. You beat him every time!
You got 3 Defense Beans!
Thank goodness you're here!
You have to help! We're in a real jam here!
A ton of Bowser's minions showed up out of nowhere and kidnapped my other Paper Toad pals!
I can count on you guys to save them, right?
Follow me! They're over this way!
Here's a little something for winning. You earned it!
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
New high score!
Mario! Luigi! Other...Mario!
Thank goodness you're here!
(If you're headed to the coast, I can help you get there!)
(Just cross this bridge and keep on going!)
(I've heard the water is as warm as a bath. Oh, I wish I were coming with you!)
Remember that...thing...that stole the Bros. Attacks from Peach's Castle?
(Are you heading to Twinsy Tropics? It's just across that bridge and to the right.)
(I was going to head there myself to help rescue the Toads that Bowser captured!)
(But...then I got scared. Can you imagine sneaking into Bowser's Castle on your own?)
Well, we know where it's hiding out! It's just that none of us are fast enough to catch it.
(I heard that Bowser launched his castle all the way up to the clouds above Mount Brrr!)
(That's crazy! I want to see it for myself! Maybe a friendly Lakitu could give me a lift...)
Although I'm the smartest, there are a total of 5 know-it-all Toads in this world.
Will you catch it for us? 
No
Yes
Oh, thank you!
Guess what? I'm the smartest Toad in this entire desert!
I even know how many grains of sand are in each dune!
Hey! Over here!
If you don't believe me, I'd be happy to prove myself.
Woo-hoo! This is gonna be fun.
Oh. I see...
I've devised a fiendish quiz to challenge all comers!
I've heard about a book that holds a parallel world within its pages.
I thought it was just the stuff of legend...
But based on what you've just told me, perhaps this book is, in fact, real.
And it sounds like it's in Princess Peach's castle!
What's the big idea, copycat?
I'd like to see you try!
And that would explain this little situation here.
What?! It's pretty obvious that YOU'RE the copycat!
Who the heck is this guy?!
Bowser's Castle
Minion! What's the status of that plan of ours?
Ah, yes, Master Bowser, the plan. It's, er, trucking along.
What kind of progress report is that?!
Speed it up! Get it done!
Y-yes, sir!
ROOOOOOAR!
Where the heck am I?!
Sheesh, would it kill you to say please?
A thousand apologies, Your Highness! I was only talking to myself!
And I want to nip this little Mario problem at the bud!
Tell the minions to hunt them down and destroy them!
Uh, sorry to interrupt.
I'll let you go back to, er, whatever you were doing.
Coming from you, that's a compliment!
Have a Hertz doughnut, paperweight!
Ugh, blech! That's nothing compared to my knuckle sandwich!
Ow! Stop pulling my hair, you lousy cheat!
Ow!
What is it?! Can't you see I'm busy?!
ARGH!
Quit it!
Master Bowser is, er, occupied at the moment. Can I help you?
That said, you picked a pretty nice style to jack!
You dirty cheat!
Thanks!
It's like looking into a funhouse mirror. Crazy!
But anyway, you showed up at just the right time. It was getting boring around here. 
The name's Bowser Jr. Pleased to meetcha!
No way! That's MY name too! Wow! OK then, let's get this party started!
My head is starting to hurt...
Master Bowser! Please calm down!
Hey! Can I get a little assistance here?
Ow ow ow! Leave me out of this!
...Has His Highness taken up ventriloquism?
My word!
What the heck just happened?!
Er, Master Bowser?
But...but...but...but!
Who the heck is this guy?!
My eyes must be playing tricks on me. There are...TWO Master Bowsers?
I don't know how you snuck in, but get out!
This is MY castle, you flimsy knockoff!
Oh, puh-lease!
YOU'RE the knockoff!
Even your insults are knockoffs! Get out before I rearrange your face!
Yikes!
Grrrrrr...
Master Booooowwwser!
What is it?! Can't you see I'm busy?!
Ugh!
There's a flurry of flat Toads and minions pouring down all over the Mushroom Kingdom!
Master Bowser!
Say what now?
Why you!
A whole mess of paper things came flying out of Peach's Castle.
This is all starting to make some sense.

And thank you, Paper Mario!
They couldn't have done it without you.
We owe you!
Everyone! It's ready!
OK! Follow me...
C'mon, Toads! Let's show 'em what we've been working on!
Yay!
Let's DO this!
Here we go!
What's going on, Toadette?
Heh heh...
It's our victory parade!
C'mon! Let's go!
Who knew that Pops had a villa way up here?
Hey, buddy!
Did you check out that awesome papercraft downstairs?
It looks just like us!
No way! This I gotta see!
Where are we? On top of a mountain?
Brrrr! I'm freezing!
At least we've got each other to stay warm!
Ah, so you run cold too?
Oh, how silly of me.
Of course you do. After all, you ARE me!
Oh, do they say that short hair isn't sufficiently princessy?
I've heard that one a lot.
Exactly! It's completely ridiculous!
I guess I could always try flat ironing it or crimping it. Or dyeing it purple!
Well, this is one of my favorite dresses...
And like I mentioned, the pink goes so well with our hair color.
But I've always been curious about how maroon would look on me.
Yes! Variety is the spice of life!
Once we get out of here, let's have a fashion show to debut our new looks!
Ooooh, excellent idea! I have a closet full of tiaras that I've never even worn!
Me too!
I do get tired of this look. Do you have any ideas about how to style it differently?
Well, there's always a ponytail.
It's good for playing sports, but it's hardly a new look.
Talk about a killer view!
I wonder where Mario is...
And of course, Paper Mario and Luigi...
If your Mario is anything like the Mario from MY world, I'm sure they're both fine.
They are very capable, aren't they?
And so caring, especially toward Luigi, who, let's face it, is...Luigi.
Well, Luigi tries his best, but... Hee hee hee!
You know, I never noticed how lovely our hair looks against our pink dresses.
The pink really seems to bring out the golden undertones, don't you think?
You're absolutely right!
To be honest, though, I've always wanted to do something really drastic to my hair.
Like chop it all off!
Me too! But someone always talks me out of it.
Marioooo!
Let's go!
Those are all interesting options, but have you considered changing your outfit instead?
There's a legend about the sea between Twinsy Tropics and Sunbeam Plains...
Apparently there's a treasure at the bottom of the sea that is guarded by a giant squid.
The squid is bigger than a mountain and sinks any ships that draw near.
Does this tale sound plausible to you?
I've been spreading it throughout the kingdom as a way to boost tourism to this area.
There's a legend about an ominous castle that floated in the skies above Mount Brrr.
This castle rained destruction down all over the Mushroom Kingdom.
From the rubble, three brave heroes rose up to rescue the kingdom from a terrible fate.
So...what do you think of the new story I'm working on? Best-seller material, am I right?
What's that? This is actually happening right now?
Oh, please, like I'm going to believe that! Stop messing with me! 
Have you heard about the amulet that grants everlasting life?
Legend has it that pirates buried it somewhere on Twinsy Tropics long ago.
Throughout the years, many have perished pursuing this treasure.
At night, you can hear their ghosts singing an eerie song...
Actually, I'm just kidding about the ghost part. And every other part.
Making up crazy stories helps pass the time in a place as slow paced as Twinsy Tropics.
Recently, a weird-looking building popped up east of here.
It's called the Lakitu "Info" Center, which makes me wonder what kind of info they specialize in.
I sure hope it's not private info. I want my embarrassing secrets to stay secret!
There's a new arcade where you can fight enemies and papercrafts you've already battled!
It's located way up in the clouds, accessible by a special pipe in any Lakitu Info Center. Check it out!
But I had my whole spiel all prepared and everything! Well, fine then.
Happy racing, racers!
All right, listen up!
This race isn't all about speed... You'll have to work as a team in certain spots too!
That means using Trio Moves quickly and confidently!
It's also important to pay attention to hazards on the course.
A little slip on some ice could cost you the entire race...
Lastly, when you come to the edge of an area, keep going!
This race will span the course of three whole screens.
You'll find the finish line all the way to the right on the third screen. Good luck, everyone!
(All right, let's race!)
We have a winner!
Unfortunately, it's not you.
Yoshi just crossed the line, making him today's winner.

Would you like to hear how to race? 
No
Yes
Goodness, that's a Bros. Attack that Nabbit dropped!
He must have stolen it from Peach's Castle.
If we catch him again, I'll bet we can recover even more Bros. Attacks!
We gotta get to Bowser's Castle eventually, but for now let's keep the heat on Nabbit!
Jump together with .

You got a new Bros. Attack, Drill Shell!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice using it!
Look! Off in the distance! It's Bowser's Castle!
Huh. I thought that it'd be much farther away than it actually is.
All right! That's where the princesses are, so that's where we need to go!
    All HP and BP restored!

New high score!
Of course the Toads are frightened, given what they've just experienced.
Please gather them so that we can welcome them properly.
I can try...if I can get them to stop freaking out long enough to listen to me.
Good idea, Mario! You might have an easier time talking them down.
OK, follow me!
Wait. Before you go, take this with you!
You got the guide!
Open it from the menu to learn about all kinds of stuff.
This is very perplexing.
I, for one, am utterly befuddled!
Good luck out there.
And don't forget to look for Mario. He'll be able to help you.
Is this...a second princess?!
I suppose I'm starting to get used to this strange, chunky world...
But it's still unnerving to see so much...depth...everywhere!
Let's see what the princesses have to say about all this, Mario.
Use the Circle Pad to walk over to them.
Did you want to chat with the princesses, Mario? 
No
Yes
No pressure or anything, but everyone's counting on you to help out those new Toads.
Oh my.
Am I seeing double?!
I may faint...
I can't believe there's a whole other dimension.
And another me!
Yes, I'm just as shocked.
Opening that book sent us all flying out of our world...and into this one.
I believe the way back home for us is through that book.
It's all so bewildering...
There, there, Your Paper Highness. We'll take good care of you.
If the two Bowsers were to join forces, I shudder to imagine the havoc they could wreak.
Can I count on you to rescue my paper subjects who are lost in this world?
This may be their greatest challenge yet...
After all, it's us versus two Bowsers AND all their minions.
Well, I'm sure once you find Mario, the scales will tip back in our favor.
Boo hoo hoo!
But Mario's right here!
Waaaah!
Oh, I see what you mean!
Yes, it's quite a pleasure to meet you, too, Mario!
Aw, are you feeling shy?
Mario, you never speak so formally with me!
Tee hee hee! I think someone's feeling a little shy!
Come on now, don't just stand there all googly-eyed.
Nice to meet you, Luigi.
Tee hee hee! You're blushing, Luigi!
Princess!
Peach!
Yes?
Huh? Who are you?
Ah, there you are! Princess Peach!
Mario! Where are you going?
The menu is your gateway to all kinds of helpful info.
To open it, press START or tap MENU on the bottom screen.
Omigosh!
I've always loved that stained glass...
To get to Mount Brrr, you'll need to go through Gloomy Woods.
They're pretty gloomy, all right. But at least you can pick berries...
Please... Take the book and help our paper friends return to their home!
We're counting on you!
No way!
It would be a real shame if we had to change it.
It's so beautiful, I could spend hours just staring at it.
Oh, so you DO know what's going on, Luigi?
Please stay safe out there.
If you have questions about anything, don't forget to check your guide.
What seems to be the matter?
Just look at its masterful use of composition and color!
So you were fixing a hole in the wall...
Princess?
It fills this room with a peaceful glow...
Oh my goodness!
It's so relaxing to look at. *yawn*... So very relaxing.
You were shocked and likely quaking in your boots...
Luigi! Do you have any idea what's going on?
It's like a dream come to life... *zzz*...
And then you started dancing... Wait, what? Why were you dancing?
...No, of course you don't.
Mm-hmm.
Are you...
I miss Princess Peach so much...and I was quickly growing fond of that Paper Princess Peach too!
I hope you can rescue them both soon, Mario!
When that book fell down.
Are you...
Me?
Uh, Luigi?
me?
Is this explanation gonna take much longer?
I appreciate your help. Those poor, scared Toads...
This whole book craziness is freaking me out.
I've got a bad feeling that something's about to happen...
Now that there are two princesses...
do we need to change the name of this castle to Peaches' Castle?
I wonder what the princesses are talking about.
Go find out and report back!
Oh, hi, Mario! You probably already know this, but you can jump with !
And just like that, those Goombas kidnapped the rest of our pals.
And Luigi can jump with !
I'm so scared that they've been creased... Or crumpled!
Mario and Luigi! The fate of the world rests on your shoulders.
Or torn up into a million pieces! Waaaah! It's too horrible to think about!
And you are?
I'm Starlow!
Oh my...
I'm a representative of the star spirits and de facto guide for Mario and Luigi.
What is it?
Pleased to meet you!
I just remembered something.
While we figure out how to get you home, why don't you do some sightseeing?
Would you like me to explain how the menu works? 
No
Yes
When we all spilled out of the book, so did Bowser and a group of his minions.
Which means that the Bowser from my world is in THIS world now too.
I'm sure Mario and Luigi would be more than happy to give you a tour of the kingdom.
That's a lovely idea.
Despite the circumstances that brought us together, I'm very pleased to meet you.
Tee hee hee!
And talking to myself like this is a real hoot!
Let's go, Mario!
PRINCESS PEACH!
Aw, don't cry! You're safe now!
They must still be in shock over appearing in this world.
That's part of it...
But actually, there's one more thing...
There were so many other Toads with us...
And they're all missing!
A flurry of Toads have suddenly appeared. They look just like us, but flattened!
That's what I just said, Luigi!
Anyway, I've never seen such a scared bunch.
They're shaking like leaves on a tree!

All right, all of the Paper Toads and minions have been safely returned to their world.
There's just one thing left to do...
This is making me sad...
Me too.
But I need to hurry back to my world before Paper Bowser starts causing trouble again...
Between you and Paper Mario, I'm sure you can handle him!
Yep! As long as you two work together, he doesn't stand a chance.
Well, this is it...
Thank you, Luigi.
This has been crazy... but pretty fun too.
I'm going to miss them so much...
Yeah. I can't believe they're all gone...
ACK! Somebody, help!
Mario! Luigi! ANYONE! Come quickly!
What? What's going on?
There's only one way to find out. Mario! Luigi!
I hope we get a chance to hang out again soon!
Thank you, Princess Peach.
Good-bye!
Be sure to visit!
Take care!
Good-bye, everyone!
I'll miss you, Mario and Luigi!
Last but not least... It's your turn, Paper Mario.
OMIGOSH! What has Bowser done now? HELLLLP!
Looks like duty calls...
Where am I?
Hey! You're flatter than a flapjack!
You guys are rounder than that snowman!

I've got the...BEST...IDEA...EVER!
I'm gonna need your help, guys!
Yes, I'm sad about the papercrafts too, Luigi. But we can't live in the past!
So! Here's what I need...
Can you collect some of the Fire Ore I've seen around the castle?
I'll show you what I mean. There's some not far from here!
Yeah! This is the stuff.
I was able to pinch a little of it when I was kidnapped. It's fascinating stuff!
If I can harness the energy of that ore somehow...
I could build a really special papercraft!
You just don't learn your lesson, do you?
Well, maybe this'll get your attention!
Eheeheehee!
So you've made it this far...
FIRE!
GAHAHAHA!
So, Mario...still looking for a fight?
If so...BRING IT!
LET... GO... OF...THEM!
These are my masterpieces!
Oh...no...
It's HUGE!
NO!
Our poor papercrafts...
YOU'RE RUINING THEM!
Luigi, be quiet!
I've got it!
I think I'll need about 3 units of ore, you guys.
That's just 2 more! Can you get 'em for me?
I'm pretty sure I saw some of it on the lower level of this place.
So that's where I'd start looking!
You got some Fire Ore!
Minions! Bring the secret weapon!
Now, I'm no ballistics expert...but I don't think we should be standing here when this thing goes off...

Oh, it's you guys. Thanks for finding me. I was too scared to leave my hiding spot...
Wow, good job finding me! I'd expect nothing less from you guys!

Right behind you!
Oh no! We lost one...
That's all of us. Thank you so much!
I was wandering around underground when I stumbled on this remote little island.
It's so pristine and untouched, it's eerie... Like it's been deserted or something.
In fact, it's the perfect setting for a thriller!
Like, what's up with all the statues? And that one pipe that's covered in ore?
It's all so mysterious and creepy.
This is some light show, huh? What in the world is going on?!
This thriller is taking a weird, sci-fi turn!
Those laser beams totally decimated the ore around the pipe!
The amount of action this little island has seen today is unbelievable!

And here you'll go head to head against papercraft bosses!
Finally, we have the Attackathon section, where you try for high scores using Bros. and Trio Attacks.

Ahhh! It's so relaxing up here. I might just take a little nap.
It's important to take some time away from the hustle and bustle of work to just kick back.
Some people like cream and sugar in their Lakitea, but why mess with perfection?
I'm taking a break to recharge before I head back into the Battle Ring.
I need to figure out what to do about that one Petey Piranha attack...
Do you have a favorite Bros. or Trio Attack?

Boots increase your power when doing a jump attack.
Meanwhile, hammers increase your power when, you guessed it, doing a hammer attack.
You get to choose which one you want to strengthen first!
You and Luigi can equip the same gear...
But Paper Mario can equip only stuff that's specific to him!
Hi! This is the gear shop!
Thank you! Please come again!
Welcome to the item shop! How can I help you today?
Now's your chance to pick up some new gear and restock your items!
You don't want to go out there unprepared, do you?
Of course, it's not all about the gear. You've got to train hard and level up too!

Oh, that did it? Heh... All right, that's the spirit, Luigi!

I almost feel like something is about to pounce out of the darkness...
Oh, Luigi...
I know it's scary, but we've got to make our way through this forest.
No matter what happens, let's stick together. We can do this!
Oh, I hope Luigi can keep it together...
Bah, I've got nothing to worry about. 
We've got two Marios!
Ow, ow, ow...
Hrrgh!
Ptooey!
Luigi!
Blech! I got grass clippings in my mouth!
Ah, Luigi. Glad to see you're...safe.
It's understandable you're scared. You're used to having two Marios around!
But now you're on your own, stranded in a forest filled with ghosts...
Right. I really need to work on my pep talks...
Luigi, listen. You can do it!
I know you can save both Marios!

Wiggler can only do so much... Even on a full belly.
What's the matter?
This gate is too zippy zappy.
Hmm. It appears to have electricity running through it.
Better not get too close. Getting shocked would not be fun!
What is it, Wiggler?
Huh? 
Way to make use of those Bomb Buds, guys!
Now, let's work on getting past that gate...
That Bomb Bud over there could be just the thing we need.
You got a new Bros. Attack, Bomb Derby!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice it!
Bomb Bud?
Yes, it's very explosive. If you chuck it, it'll blow up after a short while.
It's him!
You unzappified the gate! Yay!
I'm sure those baddies left even more trash up ahead.
Wiggler's going ahead to clean up the rest of the forest.
Wow, Wiggler really got things done! And all it took was a mountain of fruit and some bombs...
No more camping out in Wiggler's forest, pesky trash!
Shoo shoo shoo!
What's this?!
My forest is no trash can!
Time to clean up this mess!
— Warning to All Minion Laborers—
In preparation for Mario's approach, we've installed this electric gate.
Do NOT touch the generator above the gate!
Stay back!
These villains have made a mess of Wiggler's forest!
Wiggler needs to get past this gate and clean things up!
If you touch this gate, you WILL get zapped. Keep your distance!
Nature is full of danger...
We need to get past this gate!
If that Bomb Bud will help us do that, then we'll have to take the risk.

I have to admit I'm a bit jealous of the Paper Toads.
Think of it... To be able to fold up and hide anywhere...
I can't believe what Bowser did to Peach's Castle. Such a shame.
At least no one was hurt, right?
I walk the hills a lot, so I'm pretty sure I have the strongest quads in the village.
I mean, on the plus side, we did gain a Princess Peach...
There are plenty of hills and terraces around here...
Sometimes just walking around feels like a workout!
I hear that Bowser found a way to make his castle fly...and that he parked it above Mount Brrr.
I suppose if you wanted to get to the castle, you'd have to climb all the way up the mountain...
(Oh, I wish I had a giant piece of fruit right now...)
(I came here from the islands just to try the fruit that grows in this area!)
I can't believe we've got two Marios now!
I wonder what Luigi thinks about all this...
I'm totally used to the idea of two Marios, but the mere concept of two Luigis blows my mind!
(Mmm...there are fruits and berries in the forest, you know?)
(Just ripe for the picking...)
I guess people just don't like walking through the western woods to get to and from Peach's Castle...
(Someone told me there's a tree with giant fruit in the forest!)
As soon as things settle down, I'm going straight there to help patch the place up!
I suppose I just need to see the western part of the woods for myself someday...
It's like...mountains don't erupt with paper...do they?
I suppose they aren't birdwatching, are they?
Can you imagine if we had two Luigis and just one Mario? Ha! That would be ridiculous!
Oh. I'm sorry, Luigi. I forgot you were standing right there.
I'm still dreaming about that nap...
(The only problem is that there are also monsters and ghosts in the forest!)
So now we're dealing with two Bowsers, huh?
Great. That's just great...
We're so lucky to have a Wiggler protecting our forest from litter.
What happens if you litter? Trust me, you don't want to find out.
Plus, all these paper trees and landscapes have been appearing...
Not to mention all those paper baddies that keep popping up.
Do you know what's going on?
Right, just like Luigi says, we're working on fixing all this!
Welcome to our humble village in Gloomy Woods! I hope you enjoy your stay!
Whew, that's a relief!
Hey, Mario! You're my first customer today.
Business has been really slow ever since that paper terrain blocked the path to Sunbeam Plains...
Feel free to do any prep work you need here in the village before you head out!
I guess the cat's out of the bag that we're heading to Mount Brrr.
Let's get our ducks in a row and then go straight there!
What do you think of Gloomy Woods? It's nice, right?
There are so many cozy places to curl up and take a nap.
Just talking about it makes me pretty sleepy...
But back to that flying castle. Talk about extravagant!
There's no way that thing is fuel efficient.
That new paper terrain is kind of a blessing and a curse.
It can be handy when it helps you get somewhere new...
But what if it completely overtakes our world?
Remember...pack it in, pack it out. You don't want Wiggler on your tail!
The name might sound dismal, but we often get sunlight filtering through the trees and a nice breeze.
Come to think of it...who needs anything else?
You know what I'd do if I were made of paper?
First thing, I'd fold up and take a nap on the job.
ALL DAY LONG. Bwahaha!
All this stuff here is made of paper. It just...landed here out of nowhere!
Who's behind all of this? What does it mean?
Oh, it's Mario and his crew! Hello.
All of this terrain came flying down from Mount Brrr. But that doesn't make any sense!
You know, we HAVE been seeing a lot of Bowser's minions in the forest lately.
I knew it!
They're up to something—that's for sure.
I mean, it COULD be haunted. But I wouldn't know, because I'll never set foot over there.
Because it could be haunted!
I spied them working on a suspicious-looking gate!
Even stranger, the paper itself is remarkably tough...
I wonder what Bowser's minions think about when they're just walking around the forest...
Do you think they enjoy the scenery while they're on patrol?
I saw you guys flying down from Bowser's Castle!
Good thing this paper-like Mario was there to save you!
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
(I haven't found any of the fruit yet...but I'm not leaving until I do!)
It's so creepy!
Say, if you find yourself with some extra time...
could I get an airplane ride too?
Can you picture it? Luigi and PAPER Luigi? The world as we know it might collapse.
Supposedly, the western part of the woods is haunted. But I'm not sure I believe in all that.
If you come across any of that paper terrain, please explore it! Do it for science!
Hey, guys! You're back from the western part of the woods, right?
Tell me...is it really haunted?
I heard the bad news. You lost the book. There's, like, a whole WORLD in there!
Now how are the Paper Toads going to get back? You lost their world, Luigi!
I can't imagine how you could have let that happen!
Not even a giant cannonball could have knocked that book out of MY hands, I tell you...
Aw, c'mon, Luigi. Don't be like that.
I...I didn't mean it. To be honest, I probably WOULD have dropped the book if I were hit with a cannonball.
Is...is any of this helping?
Well, that sounded like a "no."
Sorry, guys. I broke Luigi.
I'm glad you're feeling better, Luigi!
So you haven't gotten the Paper Toads' book back yet, huh?
Well, that's OK. But I bet they're getting anxious to go home...
Well, keep after it, Luigi! I know you can do it!
Mario! Where's Princess Peach? Is she OK?
Whew! That's great news!
I can't forgive Bowser and his minions for all that they've done.
So, Mario, we're all counting on you to administer them a good what for!
The book that all the Paper Toads emerged from... It's very special.
You better take good care of it, Luigi!
I'll cram the Mushroom Kingdom full of my minions.
And take control!
What?!
This is my show!
Outta my way!
I said, OUTTA MY WAY!
Master Bowser!
I should be in front!
Woe to those who step on us!
Our shells are strong...
But our spirit is stronger!
Our bodies may be stomped...
But our will cannot be crushed!
We will forge ahead!
Who is the strongest?
Master Bowser!
Who is the fiercest?
Master Bowser!
Let's go!
Now that we have two armies, there's no stopping us!
It's the end of Mario and his pathetic little gang.
Hey! What are you doing?!
Fall in, minions!
Let's hear your rallying cries!
Goombas!
What do you say, Koopa Troopas?
Wait wait wait! How does a paper hammer do any damage at all?
I can clunk you on the head if you want to see...
Hey!
Hey ho!
Rabblerabblerabble...
Grimblegrumble...
Yeah!
We'll do whatever it takes to grind them into dust!
Outta my way!

Let's pretend this never happened, OK?
All righty, here you go.
Come back anytime!
Come back anytime you want to talk more!
You bought a LV 1 ? Card!
You bought a LV 2 ? Card!
You sold a LV 1 ? Card for 200 coins!
You sold a LV 2 ? Card for 800 coins!
Unfortunately, you don't have enough coins.
? Cards are super valuable, so I can't just give them away. I hope you understand.
But you don't even have any LV 1 ? Cards!
Do you want to hear more about sparkle cards? 
No
Yes
But you don't even have any LV 2 ? Cards!
You're in the right place! What do you want to know? 
What exactly are sparkle cards? 
How do you get them? 
What's so awesome about them? 
Actually, I'm fine.
Sparkle cards are a rare breed of card that can't be purchased in stores!
They sparkle like diamonds, and they're equally precious!
Do you struggle with the same problems battle after battle?
If so, you came to the right Toad!
I've heard that some enemies drop sparkle cards when you defeat them...
But that almost sounds too good to be true! And I don't know which enemies drop them...
Sure, I can help you with that.
Besides being beautiful, sparkle cards use half the amount of Star Points.
This means you can use them more often in battle. Is that nifty or what?
The Toad who was competing with me over battle cards disappeared.
He muttered something about finding some REAL competition and then stomped out.
But really, he was just embarrassed that he lost to me.
But you know, I actually miss our friendly little rivalry...
What are you in the market for? 
I wanna buy! 
I wanna sell! 
Actually, never mind.
Let me guess... You want to talk about ? Cards, right?
Welcome to the Twinsy Tropics card shop!
We specialize in cards that will help you in battles.
Or, as we like to call them, battle cards!
The more cards you collect, the more smoothly battles will go for you!
OK then! Feel free to take a peek at all the cards I have for sale.
All righty. These cards are very valuable, so I only sell them one at a time.
What would you like to do? 
Buy a LV 1 ? Card for 200 coins. 
Buy a LV 2 ? Card for 800 coins. 
Never mind.
If you're looking for battle cards, you're in the right place!
All righty. These cards are very valuable, so I only buy them one at a time.
What would you like to do? 
Sell a LV 1 ? Card for 200 coins. 
Sell a LV 2 ? Card for 800 coins. 
Never mind.
I'm sorry, but I'm all sold out of battle cards.
It might be time for me to find another career... I don't know.
I'll take a LV 1 ? Ca—
I'll take a LV 2 ? Ca—
I'll sell a LV 1 ? Card for 200—
I'll sell a LV 2 ? Card for 800—
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't go broadcasting that with a system message!
These ? Cards are rare and valuable. Keep it on the down low, bro!
What's troubling you? 
My BP drains too fast! 
Enemy attacks are too strong! 
Nothing. I'm fine.
LV 1 ? Cards full.
LV 2 ? Cards full.
Coins full.
Incidentally, each battle card is a one-of-a-kind item!
No two are the same!
If you're a collector, you'll want to get them all!
As you know, you earn Star Points faster by attacking enemies with Bros. Attacks and Trio Attacks rather than regular jump or hammer attacks.
But using such powerful attacks will drain your BP like nothing else! And, of course, there's a limit to the number of BP recovery items you have.
So, prepare for such troubled times by including a BP recovery battle card—like the one I showed you a moment ago—in your battle card set.
The card I just showed you will lower an enemy's attack power, which will reduce the amount of damage you take from that enemy.
And that's not all! If you use that battle card in combination with a card that increases your defense...
you effectively double the protection you receive from enemy attacks! Amazing, no?
So, you want to hear about sparkle cards? 
Yes, please!
Nah, that's OK.
Pssst! See that yellow Toad over there?
We're competing to see who can collect the most battle cards!
Nothing gets me revved up like a little friendly competition!
That green Toad has been giving me the evil eye all day.
I guess he's decided we're competing about who can collect the most battle cards...
I usually avoid drama like this, but if he wants to rumble, I won't back down!
There's one move that only you can do.
You can squeeze yourself through tight places!
So keep your eyes peeled for cracks in the walls and things like that!

Who knew that Pops had a villa way up here?
Hey, buddy!
Did you check out that awesome papercraft downstairs?
It looks just like us!
No way! This I gotta see!
Where are we? On top of a mountain?
Brrrr! I'm freezing!
At least we've got each other to stay warm!
Ah, so you run cold too?
Oh, how silly of me.
Of course you do. After all, you ARE me!
Oh, do they say that short hair isn't sufficiently princessy?
I've heard that one a lot.
Exactly! It's completely ridiculous!
I guess I could always try flat ironing it or crimping it. Or dyeing it purple!
Well, this is one of my favorite dresses...
And like I mentioned, the pink goes so well with our hair color.
But I've always been curious about how maroon would look on me.
Yes! Variety is the spice of life!
Once we get out of here, let's have a fashion show to debut our new looks!
Ooooh, excellent idea! I have a closet full of tiaras that I've never even worn!
Me too!
I do get tired of this look. Do you have any ideas about how to style it differently?
Well, there's always a ponytail.
It's good for playing sports, but it's hardly a new look.
Talk about a killer view!
I wonder where Mario is...
And of course, Paper Mario and Luigi...
If your Mario is anything like the Mario from MY world, I'm sure they're both fine.
They are very capable, aren't they?
And so caring, especially toward Luigi, who, let's face it, is...Luigi.
Well, Luigi tries his best, but... Hee hee hee!
You know, I never noticed how lovely our hair looks against our pink dresses.
The pink really seems to bring out the golden undertones, don't you think?
You're absolutely right!
To be honest, though, I've always wanted to do something really drastic to my hair.
Like chop it all off!
Me too! But someone always talks me out of it.
Those are all interesting options, but have you considered changing your outfit instead?
Welcome to the Twinsy Tropics item shop!
Can you smell the delicious tropical scent hanging in the air all around you?
Doesn't it just loosen your purse strings right up?
Well, please feel free to take a peek at the equally delicious items I have for sale!
Welcome to the Twinsy Tropics item shop! We have many delicious items for sale!
This shop would be way cooler if those green plants were coconut trees.
I could totally go for some coconut water right about now.
If you swapped out those plants with coconut trees, you could sell coconut water here!
Man, I could run this shop so much better, it's not even funny.
Oh no, it's a dead end!
I just want to go home!
Won't somebody help us?!
Auuuuuuuuugh!
Not over here! The other side!
Man oh man, I wonder what kind of place it is... My imagination is working overtime!
I bet the view from the top of Mount Brrr is wonderful!
Once the world stops ending, I'd really like to hike up there and take in the natural beauty.
OK, everyone!
Now that we're all here, let's build that thing for Mario and his crew!
Thisaway, fellas!
I hear that some of the shops in Toad Villages sell battle cards...
I wish we sold them here too.
I just remembered that you can use the pipe to travel to other villages.
So I guess there's no need to build a card shop here.
I wish I'd realized this earlier!
By the way, you can learn more about the Paper Toad situation at the Lakitu Info Center.
It's the last hut on the right. Stop by sometime!
Well then, see you later!
I'm gonna need all of those Paper Toads to finish the papercraft, so get on it!
Oh, you want to know what "thing" I'm talking about?
But if I told you, it would ruin the surprise! Hee hee hee!
OK! Thank you so much!
I'll need about 10 of these guys for the legs...
And maybe 20 for the head...
You know, I could get that papercraft built lickety-split with just a few more Paper Toads.
What do you say? Could you please wrangle a few more for me?
I've been wondering something.
If you gave a Paper Toad an endless supply of cake and let him really chow down... do you think eventually he would turn into a regular Toad?
You can see Bowser's Castle up above Mount Brrr even from here...
He wouldn't attack such a small village as this, would he?
I mean, it's so small that he couldn't even hit us if he tried. Right?!
Is he talking about the thing I think he is?
I think so?
But how do we build the thing?
♪ Mario, Mario, keep up the good work! Luigi, Luigi, just try not to shirk!
This is the new song I'm writing. I'm stumped about the last line, though...
Oh! I know! How about...
♪ Paper Mario, Paper Mario, don't go berserk! 
You put the thing on the other thing and then thing the whole thing together! I think.
No matter where Bowser's Castle appears and no matter how scared I get, I won't run away!
Not that anyone else here has run away...
If we had more Paper Toads, we could build the thing way quicker.
So could you collect a whole mess of them?
And then take the Toads that are here someplace safe—
Well, hellooooo there!
Hello there, Mario and company! Welcome to our humble little Toad Village.
I couldn't help but overhear that these Paper Toads will be helping you build something.
In that case, they need a ride to the workshop in Peach's Castle, right?
That sounds like a job for a Lakitu!
Oh, the Lakitu Info Center? It's right over there!
You guys focus on rescuing more Paper Toads and leave the hauling to us.
We also plan to open a shop for items and gear!
Be sure to stop by!
The princess has been kidnapped!
...Oh, but I guess you already knew that, huh?
Sometimes I get a hankering to be a traveling Toad.
The desert, the forest, the tropics... They're all but a mere jaunt from here.
Once I get enough vacation time saved up, I'm totally going to check them all out!
Sorry, fellas! This pipe is still under construction!
You can't go in!
Sometimes I catch a glimpse of a Toad out of the corner of my eye.
But then when I turn to look at him, he disappears. It's creepy, I tell you.
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
Oh, hello! Are you here to do some shopping?
You dropped a mushroom!
What a klutz! He's always doing stuff like this.
Oh, right! I have a favor to ask.
Could you follow behind that Toad and pick up any mushrooms he drops?
Hopefully that will help him be more careful!
Will you follow him? 
No
Yes
Well, if you get a chance to help out, please come talk to me again.
I'd like to ask a favor of you.
Could you follow behind that klutzy Toad and pick up any mushrooms he drops?
If you go now, you should still be able to see him! So will you help out? 
No
Yes
Thanks to you, the klutzy Toad is doing some real soul-searching.
He promises that he'll be careful not to drop any more mushrooms in the future.
Coming through! I gotta run!

Mario... Luigi...
That's right! We'll look for it together once we defeat Bowser!
Is that you, Mario? You look skinnier. I guess prison's done a number on you too.
I'm in a bind here myself. I never thought I'd end up in the Twinsy Tropics Dungeon.
Can you believe it? Me? A jailtoad?! Oh, it's just terrible.
I'm looking for a way to escape, but Bowser's minions are keeping a close eye on me.
There's nothing to do here in the clink besides eavesdrop...
I overheard some minions talking about harvesting something from this area.
I have no idea what their master plan is, but I bet you it's something nefarious. 
Bowser's minions are obsessed with collecting some special material around here.
I don't know what it is or why they're so crazy for it.
Plus, they've been keeping such a close eye on me, there's no way to escape.
So for now, I'll just hang out here and try to eavesdrop some more...
Mario and company got loose!
Ahh, it sure feels good to stretch.
But how are we gonna get out of this cell?
Good thinking! But I guess that kind of tricky maneuver is easy peasy for you.
First things first. We need to figure out where the heck we are, so let's explore the area.
What's the matter, Luigi?
Whaaaaaaat?
You can't find the book? The book that's Paper Mario's home?
The book that holds the ENTIRE Paper Mushroom Kingdom?!
No, even you couldn't have messed up THAT badly!
Check around one more time!
Mario's right. Wallowing in regret doesn't help anything.
Of course, without that book, Paper Mario and all the other paper peeps will be stuck here.
They can never go home now.
Oh, sorry, Luigi. I didn't mean to make you feel worse.
Stay away from the Boo until the timer runs out!
Keep all the Mario Bros. safe until the end to earn the most coins!

I can totally build something to destroy this papercraft. I know I can!
Exactly!
When I'm done with MY papercraft, it'll make this one look like a used take-out box.
The only thing is...
I'm gonna need a little help on the construction side.
I'm more "big picture" and less "manual labor," if you know what I mean.
But you know who's great at manual labor? Paper Toads!
So could you rustle up a few and get them to help?
Sure thing.
The Paper Toads who were just here ran north up that path.
Let's go get them!
Fantastic! Then I'll catch up with you later.
I can totally build a papercraft that'll stomp the stuffing outta this one.
But I'll need some help, so please get the Paper Toads who ran off.
Is this the right place?
You have to appreciate the craftsmanship on this thing, though.
Who knew Bowser's minions had it in them?
You really need to step back to take it all in.
Bring it over, minions!
Oh, whew!
Heave...ho!
Heave...ho!
Eheeheehee!
This is the end of the road for you!
Eheeheehee!
I've been putting the finishing touches on this papercraft.
Now I'm finally ready to unveil my masterpiece...
and unleash it on you all!
HEY!
Set that thing down gently next time. I just had it waxed!
But this thing weighs a ton!
If you want us to haul it, we're gonna need some more minions.
↑Toad Village Doop Doop Dunes →
Hmph! The cardboard in this world might be stronger, but the minions here are pathetic.
I suppose I'll have to find some brawnier ones to carry this papercraft.
Whatever. You won't get past here anytime soon. So don't even try!
We're blocked again. Now what are we gonna do?
Th-thank goodness you're here!
Wow wow WOW!
Please protect us!
The size! The strength! The stompitude! This is exactly what I've been dreaming about!

Time to put a hurt on these losers!
Heave...ho!
Dang it! I'll get you next time!
By the way, the cardboard in this world is really top notch.
Much stronger than the flimsy stuff we have back home.

All right, team. You know the drill.
We're gonna help you guys get all the way up to Neo Bowser Castle!
It's the least we can do. We're so thankful that you rescued us!
Yeah! We're so glad Toadette figured out a way for us to help!
All right, everyone. Just like we practiced...
This...evil lair...has been on the top of Mount Brrr the whole time?
Everyone ready?
Whoa, that's Mario! What's he doing here?
Yeah!
Yeah! There's no WAY he has a legitimate access card!
Everyone! Code Red! Mario is here!
Looking closely...we may also have a Code Green! The green one is here too!
Relax.
I'm sorry, but this is NOT a very relaxing situation!
So this is where all that paper terrain has been coming from...
Initiating countdown...
Self-destruct sequence...initiated.
You're looking great!
Woo-hoo!
OK, team. Let's relay a message to check our progress.
Have we reached the castle?
Have we breached the castle?
Looks like we're there!
Great! Climb on up...
Wait! Just a second...
It turns out that Toadette miscalculated a tiny bit...
Have we preached the tassel?
You got a new Bros. Attack, Toad Trail!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice using it!
Can we teach the rascal?
All right, guys. You're all set! On to Neo Bowser Castle!
Let's get out of here!
Did you eat the apples?
Run, you fools. RUN!
Are my feet made of camels?
No one can know about this operation. Soon we will all explode together!
Hold on a second! Can't we just relax and talk about this?
I'm sorry...
...but this is NOT a very relaxing situation.
We've made ourselves into stairs before...but we've never done anything THIS ambitious!
Gah!
Yes!
All right!
I'm first up, right?
Me next!
Now me!
My turn!
We've got WAY more Paper Toads than we need!
Will you take the extras with you? They just want to help out!
Here I come!
Yahhh!
Hup!
Keep it up, everyone!
Eeep!
Looks like eclairs!
Looking at pears!
Crooked old stairs!
Booking a lair!
Go to Neo Bowser Castle? 
No
Yes
We're ready. Climb on up!
Come back anytime you need to get to the castle, OK?
Mario!
What?!
Paper Toad delivery! And it's a big one!
No!
You may have passed my test...
...but there are 4 other know-it-all Toads out there waiting for a challenge!
You may have passed my test...

You'll find know-it-all Toads in all corners of the world...
Pass all of their quizzes to win something really cool!
Now, don't go resting on your laurels. There are more challenges to conquer!
Visit one of the Lakitu Info Centers and go from there...
Not to brag, but I'm the smartest Toad in all of Twinsy Tropics!
You caught me as I was pondering what could be on the other side of the sea.
I can't believe it... You passed ALL of the know-it-all Toads' tests?
My knowledge is as vast as the ocean...
That's amazing! I never thought I'd see the day...
Well, fair's fair, so here's your reward. Enjoy!
I'm totally focused on this right now, so let's plan to face off later, OK?
Well then, let's get started. No holding back, all right?
You got Mushroom Gloves!
You got 3 Bros. Beans!
Here's a little something for winning. You earned it!
The true sum of knowledge is infinite.
It makes this ocean seem a mere drop in a bucket.
My knowledge may be as vast as an ocean... but evidently yours is the size of a larger ocean.
I will keep studying. Thank you for inspiring me!
Do you dare test the waters with a quiz? 
No
Yes
Although I'm the smartest, there are a total of 5 know-it-all Toads in this world.
Ah...my competitive spirit was engaged for a moment there. Perhaps another time.
Oh! I can't believe you found a ? Card here!
Listen, Mario, do you have any amiibo? 'Cause if you do...
you can convert a ? Card into an amiibo character card! Oh, it's nifty beyond belief.
Let's go to the menu for a sec, and I'll explain!
You can also sell ? Cards.
Just talk to any Toad with a ? Card icon floating over his head.
OK, I'll let you get back to chasing down the Bowsers and saving the world.
Best of luck to you!
We've got something important in common.
Taking you down!
Plus, working together made the kidnapping process much smoother!
Gwahahahaha!
Maaaaario!
Marioooo!
We need your help!
Hey, superzeroes! Say hello to the newest member of Team Evil, my pal Paper Bowser.
Don't you pests have something better to do?!
We've got a Bowser situation!
I wasn't too pumped about this guy biting my style at first.
So our fists had a little parley... And that's when it hit us!
Here. This will keep you busy! Gwahahahaha!
He's invaded Peach's Castle!
Of course, my kidnapping technique was way better!
Was it just the one Bowser?
Oh, please! Peach wasn't scared of you at all!
↑Toad Village ↓Dock
Funny you should mention that.
One of them was!
There were actually two Bowsers!
...Anyway, enough infighting.
Oh, this is bad!
We're headed back to my castle!
And you predictable lamebrains are gonna try to follow us, 'cause that's what you always do!
Let's get back to Peach's Castle STAT!
Maybe there's still time for us to save the princesses!
There's no saving them now, chumps!
We're back!
What a relief!
Woo-hoo!
It's exactly like I remember. Wait a sec...
Yay!
I don't remember that part...
Look at that blue sky!
Exactly! Things are crazy!
You guys should check on Peach's Castle and make sure everything's OK.
We're gonna rest here for a bit, but we'll head over there soon.
Smell that delicious green grass! Mwah!
What is all this crazy paper stuff?
But we're one step ahead of you. Go get 'em, minions!
New high score!
Head to Peach's Castle! We won't be far behind.
Oh, thank you!
Will you help me? 
No
Yes
Eeeek!
Whew! Thank you so much, guys!
Here's the reward I promised you. I hope you like it!
I should probably just get out of this creepy forest for a while...
All they want to do is chase me, until I look directly at them.
But if I look away again, they come flying right back toward me!
Can you help distract them? There's something in it for you...
Very well. I'll do my best to hold them off...
Why haven't I left yet, you ask?
Well, I was actually sent here to do some research.
So I'd feel kinda bad about leaving before it's done.
I'll poke around a little bit more and then head back to the village.
Mario! Thank goodness it's you!
These Boos are terrorizing me!
Heeheehee!
I...I think they're stressed out or something!
Heeheehee!
Eeeek!
You got a Mix Badge DX!
Oh, man! You found me! I was so sure nobody would find me!
You found all of the Paper Toads!

Mario! Welcome!
We're actually closed right now.
I just can't focus on work until this minor Paper Toad kerfuffle clears up, you see.
So, if you could just hurry up and find all of them, I can open the shop again.
And you can come back and shop to your heart's (and my wallet's) content!
Nice-looking gear, Mario.
Not as nice as all of the stuff back there, but pretty good!
No discounts. Terms and conditions apply...
Did you need something else? 
Nope.
Look behind you!
Great. Well, we have high hopes for you, Mario!
High hopes that you'll come back and open your wallet...
Ah, yes, my shelves are fully stocked with the latest gear. Thank you for noticing!
Gah!
I can't believe I didn't notice that Paper Toad.
He had his paper hands all over my merchandise!
All right, let's practice jumping with all three characters at once!
When you jump with all three characters, you can start a dash when you land.
And from a dash, you can make your characters slide.
What are we waiting for? Let's try it!
OK, let's practice sliding!
To slide, you have to start by dashing. Let's give it a try!
While moving, press  followed by .
While moving, press , , and then !
So...ready to practice Trio Glider?
Press , , and  in order. Time it just right!
Go ahead—give it a try!
All right, let's practice dashing.
Got it! Now check this out...
And while we're at it, we can try sliding too!
While you're flying with Trio Glider, you can soar upward by pressing .
To dash, begin by pressing  to jump with all 3 characters.
It doesn't matter if you're standing still or moving around with the Circle Pad...just press  and hold it!
When you land, release  to begin dashing.
If you began from a standstill, make sure you're sliding the Circle Pad in the direction you want to dash.
You can soar with  up to 3 times...
So if you do it just right, you can fly pretty far.
Now slide the Circle Pad in any direction and release !
Press  to soar and get up there!
Try holding down  a bit longer.
Whoops! Be sure to slide the Circle Pad in any direction!
You've got it! Now let's move on to sliding.
Start by dashing toward me...
When you get close, you'll see an exclamation mark above your head.
Switch the action icon to the hammer with  or .
Swing the hammer with .
Wonderful! Now try it again!
Perfecto!
Now that you've mastered the basics, I have a little challenge for you!
Yup, that's it!
Go collect all of those orange orbs.
Do you want to start over? 
No
Yes
Now let's try something a little more challenging.
Reeeeady... Set... Go!
Try collecting all of the orbs.
Some of them are hidden inside ? Blocks, so jump from below to collect those.
See if you can collect all of the orbs.
Some of them might be hidden, so don't be afraid to break a few things to find 'em.
Now let's practice switching between action icons!
Actually, that sounds boring. Let's mix it up a little.
Why don't we get the hammer involved?
Press , , and then  with the right timing!
You collected all of the orbs!
Do a drill dash by holding and then releasing .
Soar with !
Stretch out forward with !
Press and hold  to jump and begin a dash.
Slide the Circle Pad in any direction, and then release !
When you see the ! symbol, press !
You caught Starlow!
OK, let's practice Trio Hammer!
When you see that, push  right away!
So the thing about the hammer...
To begin, press , , and  in order. Timing is important!
Aww, thanks for the hug! 
...is that it's not difficult to use at all!
All righty! Let's practice Trio Drill!
Go ahead—give it a try!
I'm going to run away, and you've got to catch me!
OK, let's practice jumping!
Just switch the action icon to the hammer, and then press .
Press , , and  in order. Timing is key.
Golly!
Watch carefully... Timing is everything!
To make a character jump, just press his corresponding button.
Go ahead—give it a shot.
OK, let's practice Trio Grab!
Give it a try!
There you go!
All right, let's take this to the next level!
That's  for Mario and  for Luigi.
That's it! You're a certified hammer user! All right, what's next...
To begin, press , , and  in order. Timing is important!
And now you've made your way underground!
You got it!
That...didn't...hurt...
That's  for Mario,  for Luigi, and  for Paper Mario.
How about you try hitting a switch with the hammer?
Go ahead—give it a try!
Once underground, you can hold  to charge up the drill.
Then release  to do a drill dash!
Oopsie! You were a little late with .
Well, you caught me...but you didn't slide. Let's give that another try, shall we?
Try jumping up here for starters!
Now let's get some real-world practice!
Now try pressing  while you're all stacked up.
You can stretch out like that as many times as you want.
See those orange orbs? Your challenge is to collect them all.
Some of them are buried, so you'll have to look everywhere!
Oh, your timing with  was just a little off...
Are you ready? I'm not gonna make it easy on you...
It's easier to jump onto a platform if you press the buttons in order while you're moving.
So...that's  followed by .
Try collecting all of the orbs.
Try holding  a little longer.
Whoops! Try again!
It's easier to jump onto a platform if you press the buttons in order while you're moving.
So...that's , , and then .
Some of them are hidden, so you'll have to use the hammer to flip things over.
And that's not all!
Well done!
You can also do a drill dash into certain types of walls!
Give it a try!
OK, jump up here next!

Oh, geez...
Kamek seems really set on blocking our way to Mount Brrr. I wonder why?
I hope Wiggler is OK up ahead...
Let's hurry that way and make sure!
Thanks for taking care of that zippy zappy gate!
You guys have a real knack for this sort of thing!
I'm going to make sure there isn't any more trash left up ahead. Bye now!
We need to get going too. I'm sure Mount Brrr is straight ahead!
Oh, fellows?
Over here!
Look at this!
This zippy zappy gate is even bigger than the one from before.
Wiggler can't get past it!
Eheeheehee!
Hey! It's the nonpaper version of Kamek!
You mean, the ACTUAL Kamek! Get it right!
Anyway, you're not going any farther!
Stay back!
These villains have made a mess of Wiggler's forest!
Wiggler needs to get past this gate and clean things up!
If you touch this gate, you WILL get zapped. Keep your distance!
Hold on—where are you going?! We can't let them get away!
Come along, Your Highness. Er...junior.
It's about time we head back to your father's castle.
I don't wanna!
Plus, you're the one who told me to play here!
True, but—
We've already explained to you that Mario and company will be here any moment.
We don't care! We're not done playing yet!
AND we're not scared of Mario or anyone with him!
Now that we've got this sweet papercraft, we're not scared of anything!
*sigh* Be reasonable.
Waaaah! They broke our papercraft!
Why'd you make it so flimsy?!
That does us zero good right now. Let's go back to the castle!
Yes, Your Highness.
We can't let them get away! After them!
山地のクエストは現在作成中です。 情報屋のメニューで 山地のクエストを選び クエストが始まったら 「成功」を選んでください。 2つ以上のクエストを「成功」で 戻ってくるとシナリオが進みます。

Heh. Mario! This is perfect timing.
We're gonna take this papercraft for a test drive... All over your face!
We've got a sticky situation here!
Where's Toadette and that papercraft she was building?
Here we are! Over here!
I believe I warned you about this before the battle, Your Highness.
You got a weird object that the Bowser Jrs. dropped!
That thingy looks awfully familiar, doesn't it?

Well, that was pretty sweet.
So the more Paper Toads you rescue, the more battle items they'll make!
That's even more incentive to keep rescuing them!
We've got something important in common.
Look! There they are!
Taking you down!
Our orders are to hunt them down and destroy them!
So, you know... Let's do it already!
Plus, working together made the kidnapping process much smoother!
Hmm... That's a bit of a mouthful, isn't it.
Huh? I should call you Paper Mario?
Adventure Hint
Not sure how to proceed? Perhaps there's a conveniently placed object you could dash into...
Gotcha. Paper Mario it is, then!
Gwahahahaha!
Marioooo!
Hey, superzeroes! Say hello to the newest member of Team Evil, my pal Paper Bowser.
I wasn't too pumped about this guy biting my style at first.
So our fists had a little parley... And that's when it hit us!
Of course, my kidnapping technique was way better!
Whoops! That's too much Luigi love for our new paper friend, I'm afraid.
Oh, please! Peach wasn't scared of you at all!
You confused him with the Luigi from your world, didn't you?
Actually, this Luigi is totally different.
One of them was!
And not to freak you out, but you might wanna take a look behind you too.
...Anyway, enough infighting.
So, Mario from the world in the book in Peach's Castle...
We're headed back to my castle!
And you predictable lamebrains are gonna try to follow us, 'cause that's what you always do!
Here's the skinny. There are now two Bowsers in this world. That means double the badness.
And if those two Bowsers were to start working together, that would equal evil squared!
...Math was never my strong suit. But you get the general gist.
The three of you have to work together to save our kingdom...
and help our paper friends get back to theirs!
Excellent!
With double the Mario power, we'll have this thing sewn up in no time!
Paper Mario has joined your party! From here on out, you'll adventure together in a team of three!
It's just my luck that there are TWO Marios.
Whatever! You haven't seen the last of me!
Press  to make Paper Mario jump.
Are you the Mario who came out of that book?
You confused him with the Luigi from your world, didn't you?
Actually, this Luigi is totally different.
And not to freak you out, but you might wanna take a look behind you too.
So it's Mario from the world in the book in Peach's Castle...
Hmm. That's a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?
Huh? I should call you Paper Mario?
Yeah, it took me forever to iron out the creases you put into my face!
And I'm still looking a little folded.
Anyway, I meant it when I said I'd be back with a bunch of my friends.
Now you're gonna pay!
It's just my luck that there are TWO Marios!
Whatever! You haven't seen the last of me!
Gotcha. Paper Mario it is, then!
Don't tell me you forgot already! I'm the Goomba you crumpled!
Here's the skinny. There are now two Bowsers in this world. That means double the badness.
And if those two Bowsers were to start working together, that would equal evil squared!
ACTIVATING!
Waaah! Let me go!
SUPER!
Quit squirming! You're coming with me!
Time for you to do some REAL work for a change!
GOOMBA!
Oh no! It's Mario and company! I'm out of here!
SUPER WHEEL!
We gotta help that Paper Toad!
Oops, we said "super" twice...
After them!
You're going down!
Delivery for the two Marios and Luigi! It comes directly from Peach's Castle.
Oh, and this letter is for you too.
Would you like to practice? 
No
Yes
You got something to use in battle!
All righty, then. I'm off! See you next time you have a delivery!
Golly!
You guys are really in sync!
Wow!
You guys are really in sync!
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
But we're one step ahead of you. Go get 'em, minions!

Let's go, Mario!
Paper Mario can jump with !

Hey!
Show me some of that fancy jumping, guys!
Try jumping up a few of those steps over there.
...Math was never my strong suit, but you get the general gist.
The three of you have to work together to save the world!
Excellent!
With double the Mario power, we'll have this thing sewn up in no time!
This delicious Lakitea refreshes body and mind for a mere  coins.
Would you like to purchase some Lakitea? 
No
Yes
Your HP and BP have been fully restored!　
Oh, I'm sorry, but you don't have enough coins.
This is the Battle Ring, where you fight all sorts of fierce bosses.
And here you'll go head to head against papercraft bosses!
Finally, we have the Attackathon section, where you try for high scores using Bros. and Trio Attacks.
When you get a high rating or high score in any of these games...
you earn points that you can redeem for exclusive gear in the gear shop.
Enter the Boss Battle Ring? 
No
Yes
Enter the Papercraft Battle Ring? 
No
Yes
Play Attackathon? 
No
Yes
Ahhh! It's so relaxing up here. I might just take a little nap.
It's important to take some time away from the hustle and bustle of work to just kick back.
Some people like cream and sugar in their Lakitea, but why mess with perfection?
I'm taking a break to recharge before I head back into the Battle Ring.
I need to figure out what to do about that one Petey Piranha attack...
Do you have a favorite Bros. or Trio Attack?
Test your skills at the Attackathon station!
You can try your hand at 3 different game modes here.
All right, time to go throw this book in the garbage.
And then we can hang out together and never be bored again!
OK, book, into the stinky garbage with you!
On second thought...
Let's keep this ugly garbage book for now. Who knows? Maybe it'll come in handy.
Like, if we get bored here, we could go terrorize YOUR world someday...
Yeah! Then I'll never have to go home!
It's stinky garbage time! It's stinky garbage time!
This Wiggler is still famished!
Greetings, wanderers.
Might you have something to eat for this poor, famished Wiggler?
Come on now, Wiggler!
Mmmm! A sweet scent tickles my nose.
We've already brought you a ton of berries!
Om nom nom! Mmm, simply delectable!
My compliments to the chef!
I was so hungry, this tastes extra scrumptious!
We're glad we could help.
I'm feeling quite replenished. Thank you.
Hmm...what's this?
What are you doing back here?! I thought I told you...
Wiggler smells something funny!
Yes, well...we just ran into one of Bowser's henchmen.
They took advantage of my weakened state!
And they made a mess of the forest!
Time to take this trash...
THAT HIT THE SPOT!
Actually...we can just show you...
out to the dump!
Golly, Wiggler really cleaned house!
And now the path is clear!
Onward, team!
I'm worn out from that little rampage. But if I ate, say, 10 more berries...
perhaps I'd regain enough strength to move out of the way. Perhaps.
Wiggler sure is enjoying that melon. All your hard work paid off!
Ptooey!
A full belly is a full heart. That's Wiggler's motto.
Thanks to the hefty snack you provided, I'm sure I won't run out of energy again.
Well, that's a relief.
Ahhh, delicious! But...
This Wiggler is nowhere near full!
This Wiggler is still feeling a bit peckish.
This Wiggler would like a few more nibbles.
This Wiggler is still hungry!
I think about  more would do the trick!
You got some berries!
Mm mm MM MM!
You gave a berry to Wiggler!
Wiggler is stuffed! And so sparkly! I can feel my strength returning!
UUURGH!
Nope, it's no good. This Wiggler is still too weak to move.
Unfortunately, my body simply won't function without dessert. It's a metabolism thing.
(It's my lucky day!)
(Can't believe I scored this huge melon!)
You just don't give up, do you?!
(Now all I gotta do is find a quiet place to really savor it!)
While I'd like nothing better than to stick around and give you another walloping...
unlike you deadbeats, I have work to do!
What a coincidence!
I don't have time to babysit you!
Did you know that melon just happens to be this Wiggler's favorite food?
Babbityboo!
This should keep you busy! Eheeheehee!
You got a berry!
Wiggler loves gulping them down whole and spitting out the seeds!
Well, that's that! I simply canNOT move until I have that melon to power me.
This is so important, it bears repeating.
If Wiggler doesn't get that melon...
Wiggler won't move from this spot!
Hey! Eyes off my berry!
I've got a lot riding on it, so don't even think about taking it.
See, Master Bowser loves berries, and I really need a promotion.
I'm tired of being a grunt!
Well, you don't have to yell at us!
Oof... This thing weighs a ton!
Wiggler wants the melon that Yoshi was holding. Nothing else will do!
The Yoshi was heading toward the Toad Village, so you'd best go that way too.
Ahh!
Oh, man! Now I need to find a new gift for Bowser...
What do you give a dictator who already has everything?!
When I'm done with work, I like to take a break and just stare at the snow.
I saw someone fall off that platform while trying to cross it.
He was walking really slowly when the floor just disappeared from underneath him.
Not being able to fly must be so inconvenient!
You got a piece of Fire Ore! There's 1 left!
You got a piece of Fire Ore! Take it to Toadette!
Bleheheh!
No mercy! I'm gonna smash you guys!

Nothing like catching some rays to offset the chaos of the outside world.
Ever really looked at the sun, though? I mean, REALLY looked at it?
Yeah, me neither. That'll break your eyeballs for sure! 
Oh, that fickle beast, the sun.
It brings life and beauty and happiness...
But it'll also turn on you and give you a nasty burn.
That's why I prefer to admire it from the safety of the indoors.
Bowser may be evil incarnate, but I have faith our heroes will prevail in the end!
That said, I'm still planning on hanging out in here for a bit longer...
Safety first and all that.
If you go all the way to the east side of the desert, you'll reach Bowser's Castle.
Are you sure you want to go there? His minions seem really...active...lately.
You know, that bridge that got destroyed isn't the only way into Bowser's Castle...
There's an underground area that you can use to get there.
Oh, man... What if his minions use it to get HERE? Gah...
I can't help but worry about what Bowser and his minions are up to over in that castle...
I've seen more and more tough-looking creatures roaming around this area...
Guys...do me a favor—please be careful out there!

You should head to Doop Doop Dunes next!
Besides, shouldn't you head to the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto next?
Heading to Bowser's Castle, right?
Well, first you want to go to the bridge in East Doop Doop Dunes!
This is the newest Lakitu Info Center in all of the Mushroom Kingdom.
It's fresh out of the oven!
Because of that, we're running a bit of a bare-bones operation for the time being.
Be sure to check in later once we finish setting things up.
Good news!
Now that you've rescued enough of us Paper Toads, we can help make that boat!
Wow! Just look at all of us!
With all this Paper Toad power, we'll get that boat built in no time!
I'm heading back to the dock now to get started. Meet us there later, OK?
I'm sure the boat will be ready by the time you guys show up.
All right, team! Let's get building!
We can use this paper trampoline to reach the two tall, spiky guys blocking the bridge.
OK, let's head back to the Doop Doop Dunes Grotto.
Once we get there, we'll bust out the paper trampoline.
Instead of a delivery, this time I come bearing a message from Toadette!
I will read it for you.
Ahem!
"Paper Toads will pave the way to Neo Bowser Castle!"
"A stack of Paper Toads, leading to the sky!"
"For now, though, please head to the top of Mount Brrr."
"Oh, and don't stop rescuing Paper Toads."
"If you save enough of them, they'll make you another awesome Trio Attack."
And that was the message!
Would you like to hear it again? 
No
Yes
This pipe is off limits for the time being because it connects to—
Whoops! I almost slipped some top-secret info there! Good thing I caught myself!
Please check again later.
Certificate of Commendation
You have exhibited extreme skill and dedication by clearing all possible quests.
On behalf of the entire network of Lakitu Info Centers, we offer our heartiest congratulations!
Want to revisit a quest that you've already played? Then you're in the right place!
You should head to the dock next!
You should head to Peach's Castle next!
Today's Challenge
Do you have what it takes to meet today's challenge and earn a special reward?
You'll need to clear  or more quests!
To reach that number, you'll have to try some quests in Hard Mode. Good luck!
If you're heading to Mount Brrr, you'll need to pass through the rest of Gloomy Woods first.

Toadette said to keep after the princesses!
You'll want to head east from here, so take the exit to the right. Good luck!
I hear Twinsy Tropics is a lovely place to kick back and relax.
To get there, head southeast from Doop Doop Dunes!
Headed to Bowser's Castle?
I heard a rumor that you can get there from the dungeon under Twinsy Tropics.
Looks like you've saved every Paper Toad! Nice work!
Now it's time to face off with the Bowsers for your final challenge!
We Lakitu travel the entire Mushroom Kingdom gathering information.
Some Lakitu are particularly plugged in and have access to supersecret info!
Delivery Toad here, direct from Peach's Castle!
Here you go!
I peeked inside already, and it's a new Trio Attack!
And here's one more package for you.
You got a new Trio Attack, Trio Kite!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice using it!
You got a new Trio Attack, Trio Whirligig!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice using it!
You got a new Trio Attack, Trio Meteor!
Go to the Battle Guide to see how it works or to practice using it!
You got a paper trampoline!
It's too big to set up here. Set it up later when you need to use it!
Well then, I'm off!
All right! Don't forget to save, OK?
Would you like to revisit a quest you've already played?
You can test your skills by playing the quest in Hard Mode!
Hi! Here to rescue some Paper Toads?
I can tell you guys are just itching to rescue some Paper Toads.
It's pretty big, so don't open it up in here!
There are no Paper Toad Rescue quests available for you right now.
For now, you should head over to the Goomba papercraft to meet Toadette!
Save your game frequently...
Eat a healthy breakfast!
Whoa! I can see it from here!
We've got things covered down here. Go on ahead to the castle!
Hold tight!
Protect Mario and his crew!
Good job, guys! Now keep moving!
Yeah! Don't worry about us—we'll be OK!
Go, Mario!
Go get 'em!
You're getting close...
You can do it!
Watch out! Incoming!
Oh, man! I missed my chance...
Whew, that was close!
Good luck!
Keep moving!
We're all clear now. Keep going!
Tread lightly...
Watch your step...
But don't dawdle!
Oh no!
Look out!
Evasive maneuvers, everyone!
Keep moving!
We're really doing it!

Just let us know how we can help!
We've got to get the princesses back!
That's the spirit!
Yeah! We want to see it!
Can we see it? Can we see it? I'm so excited!
You may have passed my test...
...but there are 4 other know-it-all Toads out there waiting for a challenge!
I can't wait to drive it! VROOM!
You may have passed my test...
...but there are 3 other know-it-all Toads out there waiting for a challenge!

Guys!
I need peace and quiet to finish!
You may have passed my test...
...but there are 2 other know-it-all Toads out there waiting for a challenge!
You know, I've seen the Lakitu use that pipe before...but I have no idea where it goes!
Whoa... Looks like Toadette is really focused right now...
You may have passed my test...
...but there's 1 more know-it-all Toad out there waiting for a challenge!
I bet that pipe goes right to Bowser's Villa. But I'm sure not going to test it out!
Shhh! Don't let anyone know I'm here!
You'll find know-it-all Toads in all corners of the world...
Pass all of their quizzes to win something really cool!
Now, don't go resting on your laurels. There are more challenges to conquer!
Visit one of the Lakitu Info Centers and go from there...
All the Paper Toads you rescued are gathered here now.
They're helping Toadette build the new papercraft!
What do you think of our new pipe? It's sleek and sophisticated, right?
Well, the good news is I got my job back.
The bad news is I also got fired again.
I confused the scanner with the shredder and accidentally shredded everyone's reports.
You've never heard such loud yelling...
I can't believe it... You passed ALL of the know-it-all Toads' tests?
That's amazing! I never thought I'd see the day...
Well, fair's fair, so here's your reward. Enjoy!
(Need to train some more, huh? That's OK. I'll wait.)
Supposedly Bowser and his minions have a villa somewhere in these mountains.
My question is...who in their right mind would sell a villa to Bowser?!
The Lakitus keep talking about a big scoop they're reporting on from the summit.
I wish they'd hurry up and break the story. The anticipation is keeping me up nights!
(Mario! I've been waiting for you!)
(My friend in the forest said you beat him in a race!)
(I couldn't believe it. Because he's pretty fast!)
(Well, I'm just as fast as he is, if not faster. I train on hills all the time!)
(So what do you say? Want to race me? I'll give you something cool if you win.)
Mount Brrr used to be a quiet place, but lately there's been a flurry of activity.
The tremors are something else too! What on earth could be causing them?
Did you know Bowser's Castle is literally flying above us right now?
And that it has, like, 20 cannons on it? I'm so scared!
What's the deal with that creepy door over there?
How does anyone ever get all the way over there?
Is everything OK in the village? I heard a sound that was like a thousand papers rustling...
If I find a hot scoop to report on, the bosses will HAVE to take me back.
I mean, it's not like I ever do anything embarrassing, but still...
I believe the Lakitus are scoping out that area around the cave right now...
Uh-uh. I'm not setting foot in there! But please tell me what it's like!
The climate may be a bit harsh up here, but we locals enjoy it.
Stay warm, friend!
Wow! I've never seen the village so crowded before!
I'd be worried that we don't have enough space, but...
I'm pretty sure 800 Paper Toads could stay in the same room!
I can only imagine how strange we must look to you, based on how strange you look to us!
There are other Toads from our world still out there, Mario!
Please help find them all!
If there are two Marios, there must be two Luigis, right?
Nah, that's just crazy talk.
Look at this guy. He's just like me, except he can't turn into a paper airplane. Crazy.
Toadette says this papercraft is going to be the best yet. I can't wait to see it!
Thanks for saving all of us!
When this is all over, you guys should come visit our world!
There are Paper Toads everywhere, and it's stressing me out!
I just don't want to, like, wrinkle one accidentally!
From here you can just see that mysterious entrance to the mountain across the way.
Nobody knows what's in there. Spooky, right?
I don't know about you, but I just can't relax knowing that Bowser is lurking somewhere nearby...
Thanks to all that paper terrain, we can finally access the Mount Brrr Tunnels!
By "we," I mean "you," of course.
This is just a theory, but I bet you could take them all the way to the summit!
Although...why would you want to go to the bottom of the mountain?
We've got everything you need here! And by everything...I mean snow.
We get so much snow here that there's not much else to do but sit by a cozy fire and study!
Welcome, welcome! Glad you could make it here!
Thank you! We owe it all to Mario, of course.
Welcome to the Toad Village of Mount Brrr!
It's chilly, but we don't let the cold slow us down!
Brrr! Does it ever get warm here?
Hey, guys, welcome back! The village feels warmer whenever you show up!
Um... It gets warm...ish. Yeah, uh, not really.
Wits...defeated. Morale...crushed.
Oh, I'm just kidding. You guys are amazing, though! Nice work!
Oh well! I'm just glad we're safe.
You guys should come visit our world someday!
Hey, so...
Just turn into a paper airplane and fly over to check it out! What are you afraid of?
Easy for you to say!
Sure, this village is freezing and remote.
But nothing beats the view from up here at sunrise!
Well, how about getting some friends together and making yourselves into a kite?
I hate that Bowser is flying his castle right over our village.
I bet he's spying on me around the clock!
Mario! You made it!
Look at this guy. He's just like me, but he can turn into a paper airplane! Crazy...
What do you think of our new pipe? It's sleek and sophisticated, right?
But it's not all good news, I'm afraid. Take a look behind you...
Are you ready to do this right now? 
No
Yes
This strange paper terrain has been popping up all over the place.
I wish he would hurry up and fly it somewhere else...
How much more is coming? When will it stop? Will we be covered in paper?
You got Mushroom Gloves!
Eh...maybe it would be too cold. I'll keep thinking about it.
We're all just a little concerned.
I can't believe we sold him that villa so close to our village...
Sorry—that pipe is still under construction.
When it's all done, you'll be able to ride it all the way to the bottom of the mountain! Neat, huh?
But seeing your faces gives me hope!
I just know you guys can stop both of those Bowsers...
Working sure is hard work.
The village is swarming with Paper Toads right now...
I love it! It's like a party!
I can't tell you how relieved we all are to have that pipe finished!
I just hope everyone in town remembers to still get their 10,000 steps every day.
Now that I know there are two Marios...I wonder...
Could there be even more Marios out there? Is there a world that's ALL Marios?
At first it was pretty scary when we came flying out of that book...
But now that I'm here, I wanna see all the sights!
(Race me?) 
No
Yes
Oh, is it warm? Just thinking about that makes me so happy I could cry!
Don't mind me—I was just making a snowman.
It's very relaxing. You should try it sometime!
(Wow! I've never seen anyone run that fast! Congratulations!)
(Here's your prize. You sure earned it!)
Do...do you think we can just build a bunch of snowmen and hide inside them if Bowser attacks?
I offered to help make snowmen...
But apparently Toadette doesn't "need" or "want" any more of them.
Thanks for saving us back there!
I'm just gonna wait here until Toadette finishes the papercraft.
(What's your secret? Is it the boots?)
It's so cool seeing two Marios up close like this!
Can you guys read each other's minds? I bet you can!
Hello, Mario! Hello, Luigi!
Whoa! Another Mario?! Well, hello to you too!
Seriously, the sunrise from up here would knock your socks off!
I see that the rumors I've heard about paper versions of people are true!
Anyway, welcome to our humble village.
It's chilly up here, but I hope you'll make yourselves at home!
Be honest with me. Do I look like a snowman to you?
I don't know what I'll do if I can't get back to my world...
Do you think Princess Peach will let us stay at her castle?
We don't take up much space!
Man, this building is SO round!
I wish I could take a picture and send it back to my world...
OK, so I'm guessing that if we find Bowser Jr., we'll find the princesses too!
We're going to need to find a way to get even higher on the mountain...
Now, this is kind of a wild theory, so just bear with me here...
Do you think that tunnel could possibly lead to the summit?
Nah, forget it. I don't know what came over me...
But before that, we should check in at the Lakitu Info Center.
The Paper Toads have been so helpful...
It wouldn't hurt to have a few more in our back pockets. Literally!
Who would even build an entrance like that...with no access at all...?
I'm helping build the papercraft! It's really the least I can do.
We planned a whole month's worth of parties for the Paper Toads!
But I think they just want to get back to their own world. So we'll pare it down to a cool two weeks.
You got 3 Stache Beans!
If only something really crazy would happen so I could get a nifty story.
I can see the headline now: "Horde of Flat Toads Invades Sleepy Village!"
Hold it!
Remember what Toadette said back at Peach's Castle?
Here's a little something for winning. You earned it!
I don't know why I'm making this snowman... I hate having cold hands!
Come to think of it... I hate having cold everything! Why do I live on Mount Brrr?
Right! She said we'd need LOTS of Paper Toads to get to Neo Bowser Castle from here.
I think we're just a bit shy of having LOTS of Paper Toads.
Why don't we head to the Lakitu Info Center in town?
If there are any Paper Toads that need rescuing, we can find out there.
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
I'm the smartest Toad on the entire mountain!
Some might even call me a know-it-all. And that's OK by me!
So I'm always on the lookout for anyone who's interested in a battle of the wits...
OK, that was just an expression. I'm actually freezing right now. But it's nice to see you!
Oh? You think you're up to the task? Well! We'll see about that!
(All right! May the fastest runner win!)
I'm working on building a new papercraft for you.
You can help me by rescuing lots of Paper Toads, OK?
Ah well. Such is the life of the know-it-all Toad...
If you ever change your mind, I'll be here.
You've collected some Paper Toads, but we're going to need just a few more.
You won't regret it once you see the papercraft I'm cooking up!
Although I'm the smartest, there are a total of 5 know-it-all Toads in this world.
If I fold this section, the range of motion for the torso is throttled...
But a crease there will make the headfloppitude coefficient way too high!
Think, Toadette, think! You gotta make this work!
Making snowmen, having snowball fights...
Even when it's freezing, there's loads of fun stuff to do here.
You got Speed Gloves!
You guys focus on saving the princesses.
I'll be here working on the papercraft. There are just a few things I need to iron out.
Did you see all that paper junk that fell on the west side of the village?
It looks like it'll take you directly to that mysterious tunnel.
And I do mean you, because I'm not going anywhere near there!
Have you guys seen the view from here? It's amazing!
The trees! The mountains! Everything is so...chunky!
It's pretty easy for the Lakitus to reach the summit since they can fly and all.
So they really have no excuse for taking this long to break the story!
I just know Bowser and his minions are up to no good on our summit...
But the path is so steep, none of us can get up there to check on him!
I don't know who invented pipes, but they sure are handy.
Wait! You're Mario! Maybe you know who invented 'em!
No? Oh well...
I almost feel at home here. The snowflakes are just as thin as they are in our world!
You know what's NOT relaxing? When someone comes along and stomps your snowman!
The only way to calm down from that is to build another snowman.
Would you step into a pipe without knowing where it leads?
I sure wouldn't! Maybe that's why you're the plumbers, and I'm, uh, not...
I just can't get my head around it... We're all Toads, but we're so different!
I wonder what would happen if some of the round Toads visited our world...
So our world has two dimensions. And this world has THREE dimensions!
What if there are, like, other worlds with even more dimensions?
Gah! This has been a really weird day...
I wouldn't bother Toadette right now. She's really clutching those blueprints tightly...
I really messed up at work, so the bosses gave me the boot.
But maybe if I hang around here long enough, I can convince them to hire me back.
Once everyone's in a good mood, I'll go back in and ask for my job back.
I think our kite would be a bit more like an anchor...
Toadette personally asked ME for help! Can you believe it?
It's a little cold, but this place isn't bad.
Aw, who am I kidding. It's FREEZING!
Hey, Toadette!
Is the new papercraft done yet?

You saved the Toads!
Thanks for busting me free. The air in that bubble was the worst!

Whew! Boy, am I glad that nightmare's over!
I can't believe I'm being saved by the famous Mario! What an honor!
Oh, thank goodness! I can finally relax now that you guys are here!
Hey! It's you guys! Well, this is a nice surprise!
When I'm chased, I just run. Thanks for catching me and snapping me out of it!
Oh, it's you guys. Thanks for finding me. I was too scared to leave my hiding spot...

I'm sure we'll get that book back soon, Luigi.
OK, enough boohooing!
Ugh! Can't...squeeze...through!
You can fast-forward with .
Um... Thank you for moving that along.
Waaaaaaaaiit!
Did that thief abscond with something of yours too?
He's positively notorious around these parts for his stickyfingerness.
His favorite pastime is running off with treasures from Peach's Castle.
You know, items and attacks. Things of that nature.
We really ought to fix that security hole one of these days...
Halt! Thief! That's OUR book you just stole!
Somebody help us!
We should return the Paper Toads to the book world.
Luigi, will you do the honors?
Hey, that's our book!
Yay! We can finally go home!
What in the—?!
Press  to make Paper Mario jump.
We need that!
Hello? Can anybody hear me?
You come back here this instant!
Look, it's a Paper Toad!
There, there, Luigi.
Eeeeeeek!
Don't blame yourself. It's not your fault he stole the book.
A G-G-Goomba!
Well, hellooooo there!
Leave me alone!
His flatness is pretty handy for getting through tight spots.
But it makes it difficult for us to rescue him.
HAAAAAAAALP!
Glad I have your support.
Wait a sec... Didn't we already beat this guy?
Let's refocus our efforts on rescuing Paper Toads in distress, OK?
I'll try to explain this fast so you can get to the saving-me part!
I'm as anxious as you are to move on, but please don't press  to fast-forward!
Well then, I'll be off. Best of luck to you!
OK, let me cut to the chase. You did indeed defeat Petey Piranha!
However, this here is the PAPER version of Petey Piranha!
The whole paper-enemy situation has gotten out of control lately!
Let's keep up the good work and rescue even more Paper Toads!
Paper enemies raining down from the sky... Toads weak and trembling with trepidation...
Is the picture I'm painting grim enough for you? The Mushroom Kingdom faces its greatest crisis yet!
Facing this crisis are the two Marios.
In their hands, they wield only the weapon known as courage.
Well, that and hammers.
Next to them stands Luigi, flames of determination burning quietly behind those eyes of his.
Those, er, blank eyes of his.
But I digress! Can these three heroes deliver the Mushroom Kingdom from certain doom?
And what of me? What will be the fate of this humble Toad?
Let's go see what his story is.
↑Gloomy Woods
Oh dear! All this paper junk is blocking the way to Gloomy Woods!
    All HP and BP restored!   　
    Don't forget to save your game!    　
But do you see that platform up there?
Those things can be pretty useful!
If there's another one around somewhere, maybe you can figure out a way to get on top of it...
What am I saying? Of course you can! You're Mario!
While moving, jump one after another with →→!
I went ahead and took those Paper Toads to Peach's Castle.
Luckily, they were super light, so there was no danger of shell strain.
Mario's right, Luigi. Being glum about it won't help anything.
So chin up, OK?
Let me see if I understand this correctly.
Luigi was playing the hero. Or TRYING to play the hero, I should say.
And because he was paying attention to his own grandiosity, the thief saw an opening and made off with the book.
Yes, I can see why he'd feel so ashamed.
There's no need to rub salt in the wound! Can't you see he already feels back enough?
I have new information on the Paper Toads.
A while ago, the shopkeeper offered me a job here.
But what would they do with even MORE staff?
Seems like we'd be bumping into each other left and right!
Even so, it's hard to say no to pocket money, so I'll think it over.
Welcome to the Twinsy Tropics gear shop!
I gave it some thought and decided to work here!
I'm a trainee, so I'm still getting up to speed.
Learning all the different types of gear is actually pretty hard.
This shop might not have a lot of customers, but it sure has a lot of employees!
In the market for some new gear?
We don't get a lot of customers way out here.
You're my first customer in a while, so you'd better buy a lot!
Hee hee hee hee! Just kidding. Happy shopping!
The gear selection here can't be beat, so browse to your heart's content.
This papercraft is made of the strongest, most durable stuff out there!
That's why it's—oof—so heavy!
So let's get it built and show those knuckleheads who's boss!
This thing is so heavy! Where am I supposed to put it?
A smidge to the right.
Hoo... Hoo... Hwah... Done!
I said a smidge, not a scooch!
OK, move it a tad to the left!
But, Toadette, now I'm back where I started!
Ugh, never mind. I'll do it myself! Give me that!
Hmph, you call this heavy, noodle arms?
Listen, if you want to achieve greatness, you have to be willing to work for it!
Just a few more tweaks, and my masterpiece will be complete!
Now hold on right there!
What do you think you're doing?!
You're a total backstabber!
Hey, look! There's a pipe!
Ha ha ha ha! I'm not a backstabber— I'm a master strategist!
And this was all part of my master plan!
With this little coup, Bowser's sure to forgive all of my past mistakes.
Heck, I might even get a promotion to Lead Minion!
Consider yourself outsmarted!
All right, enough chitchat. See ya, chumps!
I bet it'll take us aboveground.
I can't believe this!
We've come way too far to go back now!
Ha ha ha ha!
We have to get that medallion back, no matter what it takes!
Heh heh heh!
HOLD IT!
You could have just sat quietly in your cell like good little prisoners...
But noooo, you had to escape and make us chase after you. So inconsiderate.
We're gonna make you pay for double-crossing us!
Whatever! This is as far as they're getting!
*sigh* Just when I was back in good with the rest of Bowser's minions...
Hey, Larry! Come help us subdue these prisoners!
It's time to run away again!
Where is he?
Stop!
Probably off playing video games or something.
Um, guys? Aren't you going to help me catch him?
Hey, guys! Wait up!
To get to Bowser's Castle from here, you need a red medallion!
Do you have something like that?
Really? Let me see!
Wow!
Let me take a closer look at it and make sure it's not a knockoff.
Hmmmm... It definitely looks like the real deal!
Hey! Everybody! Look who's back!
These rats might have escaped, but they came back with something good!
That's the medallion for the gate to Bowser's Castle!
Whew, good thing we got it back! That was a close one!
They could've done some major damage with this!
Let's...not let the boss know about this little mix-up...
Ugh, it figures. Do we have to do everything ourselves?
Oh, I see. You don't want to waste any more time.
It's OK. I don't think these three are gonna put up much of a fight!
You make a good point. Let's head for the gate with Bowser's face on it!
And keep an eye on the medallion. We don't want to lose it again.
Hey! Larry!
Stupid Larry! If he had been here, there's no way we would've lost!
Yeah! This isn't over, chumps!
OK! Now we can finally get out of here. Quick! To the pipe!
Now's our chance! Skedaddle!
You guys are the best! Thanks for everything!
Gwahahaha!
We've completely destroyed Mario and his crew!
The plan is also proceeding nicely. The Toads are hard at work underground.
They're working so hard, one might even characterize it as "toiling."
Daaaad!
What is it, Junior?
Daaad! I'M your son!
Look what I have!
Son, I'm busy right now. We can talk later.
I like special surprises! OK, let's go to the villa!
Whyyyy meeee? Standing guard is the most boring job in the world!
Yeah! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
*sigh*
Hey!
We're heading out to the villa now!
And so are you!
No one likes a whiner, Junior.
We don't care! We don't wanna do it! We hate guard duty!
Why not send the young masters to the villa? The fresh air would do them good.
...And the peace and quiet would do US some good.
I'm sure the papercraft will provide a welcome diversion.
Right, I almost forgot!
Junior, I have a special surprise just for you!
But if you want it, you'll have to go to the villa!
But won't it be obvious that we've escaped?
Not with...this!
Ta-daaaa! A helpful Toad gave me this for situations exactly like this.
It may not fool the Bowsers, but perhaps the Bowser Jrs. won't be so perceptive.
I'm so tired of getting kidnapped.
I mean, it's not all bad. I actually don't mind flying in the clown car. But...
If I have to say, "Save me, Mario!" one more time, I'm going to scream.
I want you to keep an eye on the princesses, Son.
All right, time to go throw this book in the garbage.
And then we can hang out together and never be bored again!
OK, book, into the stinky garbage with you!
On second thought...
Let's keep this ugly garbage book for now. Who knows? Maybe it'll come in handy.
Like, if we get bored here, we could go terrorize YOUR world someday...
Let's go show the book to Dad! I bet he'll get a kick out of it.
Yeah! Then I'll never have to go home!
It's stinky garbage time! It's stinky garbage time!
Do you ever feel that way?

Are you ready? It's time to get this started for reals!
It's pummeling time!
Ow... Ugh...
You're not as wimpy as you look...
Whatever! We'll be passing through now!
Oof! This was all part of the plan!
Don't think you can just waltz up to Bowser's Castle!
Or, you know...DO think that. Because, like I said, losing was totally our plan...
OK! We're almost there. We should proceed with caution...
Hey! Who said we need a pass? And who are you all, anyway?!
I can't see anything past that bushy hair of yours!
What's this balloon squeaking on about?
What! How rude! I'm no balloon!
I'm Starlow! Representative of the Star Sprites and leader of this team of heroes!
If it weren't so dark in here, you'd be quaking in your boots, believe me!
Speaking of boots...
I got stuck trying to get out of that pipe.
Why'd we stop? Is something bothering you?
You have a strange feeling about what lies ahead?
Eh, don't overthink it!
If you didn't feel at least a little strange about what lies ahead...
well, that would be pretty strange in and of itself, right?
See! I told you you were overthinking things.
There was nothing to worry about at all!
Don't make me nervous!
Ready when you are!
*cough cough*... *gasp*
Sorry for the collateral damage, guys.
I guess Supernova Sparkle isn't the best attack for tight spaces.
Now you're gonna get it!
SHUT IT!
Don't make me show you what I can really do!
You're standing on the wrong side of this face-off!
And where's my backup?! Ludwig, get your shell OVER here!
Oops! My bad!
That's what you get for trying to sneak through here without a pass!
AUUUUGH!
Luigi, are you all right?!
Your mustache fell off! Stick it back on before anyone sees!
And take this too!
Visitors beyond this point need a pass!
Oh no! Mario!
They've pummeled you flatter than a pancake!
Wait, no, you're PAPER MARIO, aren't you. My mistake!
Ready to give up now?
Now you've gone and made me mad!
Time to unleash my ultrasecret special attack... 
Supernova Spaaaaarkle!
Hey... You're a real shrimp. It was so dark in there, I had no idea.
Hold it right there!
After all, past this point lies...

Oh, thank you! I thought I'd be lost forever in this dank cave...
Mind if I slip into that pocket of yours now? I'm freeeeezing.
Hi there!
Eek! That freaky yellow ball is talking to me! Wake up, self! Or at the very least, run away!
Wait! Come back!
All right, fellows. Looks like we'll have to catch him.
I don't know where he went.
Golly, that guy can shake a leg!
Good point. I'm sure we'll run into him again soon.
For now, let's just keep moving forward.
Stop following me!
Wh-where are we?
Well, what do we have here? A bunch of skinny Toads?
Round them all up!
Is it me, or are these guys looking even punier than usual?
No one cares! Just capture them!
GET 'EM!
Wh-what's happening?!
EEEEEEEK!
Look, Mario...
Sunbeam Plains aren't very plain anymore.
Are you headed through Gloomy Woods to Mount Brrr?
If so, you'll need to get around this paper terrain somehow.
There's got to be another path around here somewhere.
It looks like you can't pass through here.
Try finding another path.

New high score!
Oh no!
Someone help!
All of my friends have been abducted by weird-looking versions of Bowser's minions...
And all my surroundings are so much more vivid than normal.
What is going on?
Oh, of course! I must be dreaming! What a relief!
What's that you're saying now, Luigi?
You're worried about all the Toads the Bowsers have kidnapped?
You think they're probably scared out of their minds?
You can picture them wringing their nubby little hands with fear?
You can hear their high-pitched wails...
And their shouts of "Oh, please save us, Luigi! We need your help!"
Is that what you're saying?
You can dash to get back to the other side.
Just one left to move! Oof! We can do this!
OK. Ready... Set... Toss!
Oh dear. Don't tell me you were captured too. Mining this ore is terribly hard work!
Every part of me is sore. My back, my feet, my arms... Oh, it's just awful!
We've been working nonstop, gathering and hauling ore.
From here, it's shipped directly to Bowser's Castle.
I don't know what the Bowsers are planning to do with it.
But if history is any indication, it's probably something horrible!
Huh? You're wondering why we don't try to escape?
Well, there's a pipe just past here, but Bowser's minions are patrolling the area.
What's that? You guys will take care of them?
Well, if anyone can do it, it's you.
Oh no! Here comes one of them now! You guys better hide!
Hey! Slackers! Who told you to stop toiling? We need more ore!
Hmm... Looks like this area is all dried up.
This looks an awful lot like Bowser's face, doesn't it?
What's that, Luigi? You think there's something suspicious about that?
You think we should remember this exact spot because it might be important later?
Because the sort of adventure we're on always has some kind of foreshadowing device?
Wow, Luigi. That's a terrible scene you're painting!
Luckily, it's not very realistic.
After all, I'm pretty sure they would be calling for Mario's help, not yours.
What's that, Mario?
You think this wall is somehow connected to Bowser's Castle?
Good thinking, but what I can't figure out is just HOW they're connected.
But definitely remember this wall. I have a feeling we'll be seeing it again.
And now...back to the adventure!
Let's keep moving, team. We gotta find a way out of here!
By the way, were you two chatting?!
WE'RE NOT PAYING YOU TO CHAT!
Course, we're not paying you at all, but you know what I mean!
I want less chatting and more toiling!
W-we weren't chatting, sir!
What you heard was our, um, anguished moans.
Is that so? They didn't sound very anguished.
Anyway, I don't have time for this.
Stop your bellyaching, and get back to work!
It's all clear. You can come out now.
Good luck escaping from here. We're counting on you to free us!
We'll be keeping a low profile down here, but know we're rooting for you.
Quietly rooting, that is.
Here we are again.
Oh, man! I thought for sure that would open up a direct path to Bowser's Castle!
But instead...we just found another wall.
Well, looks like it's time to break out Trio Drill again...

Shhh. You're delirious. That's just a piece of garbage on the carpet.
We can't let them escape like that. Let's get 'em!
Oh, man, probably both!
There it is, Luigi!
But the book is OURS now! We're never giving it back!
These guys must have had it all along!
Hmm...
Well, we know you've got it now. So give it back!
And, you know, release the princesses, obviously.
Hey, buddy.
I kind of feel like these guys didn't know we had the book.
Maybe we shouldn't have pulled it out just then.
How could they have done this to MY son?!
Son, you're talking nonsense. Is your brain OK?
Why should I care about a stupid garbage book?
Don't answer that, Son. Just relax while Daddy roasts Mario to a crisp.
So it's come to this.
Hey, buddy! Why did we even run away the first time?
Fighting is more fun, don't you think?
Urgh...
Buddy...
Um, Dad...
Dad...the book...
Junior!
That was a dirty trick, running away while I was asleep!
I'm gonna tell Dad all about it—just you wait!
So...you think they're here to steal back that book, or just the princesses?
The princesses were just walking around freely. Hostages aren't supposed to do that!
And I don't mean to just keep piling on, but do you even SEE Mario over there?
I suppose it doesn't matter now. We've finished the modifications to the castle. Heh heh...
I think so!
...What's wrong with you? Why are you just lying there?
What's up?
What did you DO to my son?!
Looks that way.
Junior! Wake up. I have something to show you...
Mario! Thank you so much!
You're right! Let's fight 'em!
Maybe not our best move.
Kamek! Listen up!
It's what Dad would want.
Hah! Like we'd just give up like that.
Fire the boosters. NOW!
Don't let them get it... We need it...
Hey, buddy! You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
What do you think, Junior? I call it...NEO BOWSER CASTLE!
Go on—take a look out the window. It'll cheer you up!
Let's run away!
Oh, the whole place is shaking... What's going on?
Guys, the book is still over there! But we need to get out of here...
I...I think the whole castle is airborne!
You know what? I think we should forget the book for now. Let's get the heck out of here!
