You have done well... I have watched you...
I will show you... your ranks...
I am less than amazed... but you can try again...
Reach higher ranks... and good things await...
At these ranks, you... bested the Dark Star...
That is amazing... You have done well...
Reach higher ranks... and good things await...
Everyone grew super strong...
You are amazing... Very well done!
I rarely give praise to the unenlightened...
But you truly are absolutely amazing!
And now I go.
Stop talking nonsense! And what's a Fawful?
Sir, if you would please take your seat and be patient!
The theater has been temporarily relocated to Dimble Wood.
But the show will go on!
Young Master...I believe these Goombas are under some sort of spell.
Hey! Goombas! Snap out of it!
Please take your seats! The show will resume as soon as the theater resumes existence...
Have a seat!
Yo, Kamek! I'm bored with these guys. Let's go get that stuff from the basement.
But...young Master...
Are you not concerned that your father's castle is simply...not here?
Yep...the castle is still gone. Huh.
Super helpful, Kamek. Hey, some Goombas!
Welcome, welcome! Please find your assigned seats. The show will go on!
Can I take your jackets?
Show? What show? Did someone stomp you too hard? What are you even talking about?
Welcome to Fawful Theater! ...Is what we would have said.
But, as you can see...
The theater is currently in a state of not existing. Just temporary, we assure you!
Be reassured!
The basement's still here, right?
So who cares? I wanna make that Skeletone stuff!
But the Skeletone is only needed for reviving the blorbed minions.
It's of no use if there are no minions remaining!
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?!
I don't care about the minions! I care about me!
So when I say something, YOU JUST DO IT! GOT THAT?!
This is unwise, young Master...
Please take your seats!
Can I take your jackets?
Very well. Young Master, come this way.
You aspire to travel? 
Don't travel.

Yeah, uh, we'll take it.
Go ahead and hand over everything you've got.
Oh, well I'd be extremely grateful for the business...
...if I had any more Skeletone to sell you.
I'm afraid that I only brought a trial sized portion with me today.
That little bottom doohickey rotates pieces whenever you give it a touch.
Gotta get them pieces facing the proper way now, tots.
It looked like this...

Move pieces with the stylus. Rotate pieces with the rotator.
You tots've done a jigsaw puzzle before, ain't you?
You just take all these broken pieces here and stick 'em in the right places.
Get your stylus ready. Touch them pieces with that there stylus.
While touchin' pieces, move 'em over the puzzle frame.
If the pieces stick to the frame and stay stuck, well, that's their proper home.
That little bottom doohickey rotates pieces whenever you give it a touch.

That's how you do a puzzle. Easy, ain't it?

No.
Yes.
This castle... It had a name... Long ago... Browser's Castle? Mouser's Castle? Wowser?
Ummmmm... Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh... Darn it, just not remembering. Guess it doesn't matter.
Whoa... Gotta say, dude... The 'stache... Way cool!
It's the king of 'staches! Totally! Emperor 'Stache! I need me one of those!
Welcoooooooome, guest! Welcome to Fawful Theater!
The theater is just straight through the doors, of course.
And to your right, a pipe that leads underground, but there is little to interest guests there.
You're so very right, darling! But he's not as dashing as my sweet darling, darling!
Oh, my daaaaarling!
And above all... Lord Fawful...
As I expected, seeing Lord Fawful from the front row was the coolest!
I was so close that, when he was cheering us on, I could see the spit fly off his teeth!
I'm not even kidding you! Some landed on my face...
EWW! NASTY!
I was told to never go in the preservation chamber below the castle...
But the second I got told that, I wanted to go in for sure. What could be in there...
Oh, boy. Looks like trouble up there.
They won't listen to you.
Fawful controls them now. They've been brainwashed.
For now, I think you ought to go in and have a look around.
Got any Fawful Cards? Aw, weak, dude, you don't? Sooooo VERY LAME!
You know you can trade 10 rare cards for an Ultra Super Premium card, right?
I mean, everyone knows. Well, see you around, huge old angry dude...
So Lord Fawful is making Peach's Castle his own!
And he decided to make this dirty old castle a theater!
Simply brilliant!
Hey, old angry dude! You nab yourself Lord Fawful's autograph?
Huh? You didn't? Y'know, big guy, you are soooo GIGA LAME!
Tonight's Fawful Show begins SOOOOOOOOON!
Hm? Underground chamber? Heehee! I don't know. Honest!
But it's called underground... Why not LOOK underground?
Ah. But the path down there is under construction...
Rather than looking below, look at the statue of Lord Fawful on the balcony.
Did you check out the statue of Lord Fawful on the balcony? It's an INCREDIBLE likeness...
Oh boy, I wonder what performance Lord Fawful will give tonight.
Yaaah! Yaaaaaaaah! I wanna see it now! Right now! Right now!
Listen a minute! Someone broke Lord Fawful's statue!
Who would do such a horrible thing? Especially to such a sweet statue...
Welcooooome, dear guest! Welcome to Fawful Theater!
The evening's program is yet to be announced.
But it will. Maybe. Depending on how Lord Fawful feels.
Look at this signboard, honey. Lord Fawful is sooo dashing. Just look at him, honey!
Now, now, settle down, honey. You go too far. You push it.
But you're quite adorable when you say darling, honey!
My sweet honeeeeey!
I've been camped out at the front of the line for 10 days now--for Lord Fawful's show!
I'm totally starving! Seriously. I mean, just look at me! I'm down to bones over here!
YES! FINALLY!
Uh... Guest?
Fuh... Fawful Theater?!
Don't joke with me! This is my castle!
HEY! IDIOTS! You KNOW me! Knock it off!
NNNGRRRRARGH! STOP SAYING THAT!
Crud!
Great. Not only did this guy take over my castle, but now he's all up in my minions too!
Stupid Fawful! That guy is gonna PAY!
"Now accepting applications for the Fawful Fan Club"! Man, I HAVE to get in!
Where's the sign-in desk? Hey, are you the recruiter?! ...No? DARN IT ALL!
That seat up front is mine!
It's a heavy job, conquering the Mushroom Kingdom. I mean, Lord Fawful has his work cut out.
He's stressed, we're stressed... That's why you've gotta have a stress-release show, right?
You agree, right? I mean, right? You're loving the shows, right?
No matter how many times I see Lord Fawful's show, I'm amazed! Each time, I'm like, "WOW!"
WELLCOOOOME!
A guest arriiiiives!
Welcome, dear guest!
Guest!
Welcome to Fawful Theater!
Pleeease wait in the lobby! Soon the show will start!
Pleeease wait in the lobby! Soon the show will start!
Start!
Hurry up! It's starting!
Mr. Mario and Mr. Luigi, thank you so much.
Your balloon condition is fascinating. No doubt it will help you reach great heights.
If you find any air vents in your travels, I recommend using them to balloon up!
I believe your next destination is Plack Beach, correct?
If that's the case, then go south from Blubble Lake.
Good luck gathering those Star Cures, you two!
You can jump that high, right, Mario? Catch that bird!
Wait, are we really locked in the clinic?
Take care of our cute little Birdley!
Good luck out there, Mario Bros.!
You're off to Peach's Castle?
Wow, well, good luck to you, Mario Bros.!
Good luck, Mario Bros.!
FYI! FYI!
Birdley! You little scamp, what now?
Come here, you!
OH WAIT!
It took a big jump to get in the room!
That's all I remember... That's...not very helpful...
Stupid memory!
Mr. Mario. Mr. Luigi.
This way please.
Dr. Toadley told you, right?
Yes. We would like you to take this Bros. Attack.
Keep an eye on your BP and use it sparingly in battle.
And try to go to sleep early in the evenings, OK?
And be sure to eat a varied diet... Not just mushrooms.
Well, take care of yourselves... I mean...
Keep up the good work for the sake of the kingdom!
You got 10 clinic Attack Pieces at once!
All clinic Attack Pieces found!
You got a new Bros. Attack!
What are you doing?! Mr. Mario!
Good gracious! You ballooned!
Fascinating! Perhaps... Mr. Luigi! Try jumping!
Look at that vertical leap!
But... How do we reverse your condition?
You've rather expanded, haven't you, Mr. Mario...
If you press  you'll jump so very high!
And...ah, yes. Pressing  makes Mr. Mario exhale and return to normal.
What a wonderful find! This condition will help you catch Birdley!
I definitely remember Attack Pieces!
I've seen so many, but these were so sparkly!
The attack they'll create must be incredible!
But I can't remember the essential details...
This is an emergency! If you two get blorbed, the kingdom's doomed!
You two must see the doctor immediately! Come with me!
Birdley! Calm yourself! Come down from there!
It's just AIR! You don't need to get so worked up about it!
FYI! FYI! FYI! FYI! FYI! FYI! FYI! FYI!
Birdley fed up! Birdley go home!
Birdley on strike! Birdley overworked!
Oh, Mario and Luigi! Can you catch Birdley?!
He locked the exit door and took the key!
Now I can't get out to find the vent repairman!
Help, you two! Capture Birdley!
Dr. Toadley's a famous doctor AND a famous fortune-teller.
This clinic is packed because of the blorbs...
Did you try heading into the room in back?
I went in a strange house on Plack Beach...
I went in a strange house on Plack Beach...
No! I have no memory of what happened next!
And then Bowser's Castle! A cold room in Bowser's Castle!
In Bowser's Castle, in a cold room... A mushroom shape...
No! My memories... All gone! Just a haze of images...
I'm a total blank!
The blorbs patients all got cured!
My big brother's an adventurer.
He went out looking for some Attack Pieces but...
I guess he ate some Blank Mushrooms out there...
Now he's blanking on all his adventures up until now!
Overalls warm!
Birdley comfy!
Birdley nesting!
I wish someone could help him remember...
All right! You'll find 'em! You're Mario, after all!
Trust me, the attack must be incredible!
Looks like you have a... tenant! But he can help!
Birdley, you help show Mario the way, OK?
Brother... About Plack Beach and Bowser's Castle?
Oh...really...
And it was surely such an incredible attack, too...
Birdley got it!
Birdley guides!
I found a strange house in the Plack Beach area...
And there was...shuffling? What does that MEAN?
Shuffling and...a puzzle?
Oh, this is driving me NUTS! I just can't remember!
I'm a total blank!
Mario! Please check it out! 
Nah.
Sure.
Hey! Mario! You pulled it off! Found the Attack Pieces, huh?
But there should be more in the cold room of Bowser's Castle!
Yeah, below Bowser's Castle... A cold room... Tough to enter...
Ummm... Uhhhhhhhhhh... Oh... I'm a total blank!
Sorry, Mr. Mario...
Take care of our Birdley, OK?
What... Where...
Hey! Mario! You pulled it off! Found the Attack Pieces, huh?
But there should be more in the Plack Beach area!
In a strange beach house!
Ummm...Uhhhhhhhhhh... Oh... I'm a total blank!
Mario, maybe you can check things out for my brother...
Plack Beach... Bowser's Castle...
From what I can tell, there are Attack Pieces in both places!
Hey! Mario! You pulled it off! Found the Attack Pieces, huh?
So... Are there any others? What? Do I know of any more?
Here at the clinic? Or not? Argh... I'm a total blank!
Plack Beach Attack Pieces? 
Bowser's Castle Attack Pieces? 
Never mind.
I was hunting Attack Pieces in a cold room in Bowser's Castle...
There was a purple monster... The shape of a mushroom...
AAAARGH! NO GOOOOOD! I just can't remember!
I'm a total blank!
Mario! Please take a look! 
Nah.
Sure.
An entry was added to the Guide.
You caught Birdley!
That little cut on the back of my head is totally healed!
Thank the doctor for me! And thank you, too...
Well, Dr. Toadley would like to keep an eye on it, so pop back in for a checkup next week.
Heh... Hope you help me then...
OK! Next patient!
Oh, what's this? Luigi and Mario!
Is something ailing you today?
The doctor can only see one patient at a time.
I'm afraid you'll have to come in one by one.
What? You want to consult the doctor at the same time?
We really shouldn't... For that, you really need an appointment...
If you don't mind me asking, what ails you, Mario?
Your mustache has a fine sheen... You seem quite healthy.
And Luigi seems to be jumping with vigor...
Sore throat! That could be an early symptom of the blorbs!
No! Chest pains?!

Not enough...
King Bowser! You're OK?!
King Bowser? Something wrong?
WHAT?!
Wow! Really?
Solid work, Chippy! Gimme that combo!
That's... Yeah! That's IT! Now I remember!

  9  8  3 Whoop-de-WOO!
GWAHAHAHA!
Unh! Can you feel that?! The second is MINE!
What?!
Where?
Stop being stupid, and remember the stupid combination!
Ow! Hey! Minions! What're you doing?!
Of course!
King Bowser! There's something else inside that safe!
Yeah, I remember!
I didn't know what the thing was, but it looked pricey, so I stuck it in this safe...
Heh heh.
...I forgot it.
The Age of Bowser is...
OVER!
The safe combination...
Yeah, I guess...
NNNNGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! C'mon, you stupid brain!
So we oughta toss this thing somewhere, right?
Haah... Hooooo... Haaaaaaah... No use... Can't remember...
HEY! CHIPPY! COME IN, CHIPPY!
Yeah, I did, but you can find it! Look around inside my head! It's in there somewhere!
Your tone... I don't like it.
That haughty, commanding tone of voice! I don't like it!
Go help yourself!
    
  ............
...That's better.
OK, the inside of your head is fragile, so stay totally still.
I'll go look. Be right back.
Lord Fawful will reward us well for this noble act, men! Can you say "extra rations"?
Hmm... Where...
...Ah. There, perhaps?
Begin safe incursion, sir!
Sir?
1, 2, 3!
VICTORY!
LEMME OUTTA HEEEEERE! OPEN THIS DOOOOOOOR!
Stupid minions!
You idiots fell under Fawful's control at some point, huh?
THIS IS MUTINY!
I FORGOT IT!
That Star Cure is in the safe, I'm so sure!
Uh...Bowser?
FIND IT!
Your Forgetfulness! Get ahold of yourself!
WHAT?!
Mmm.
What the... HEY! Find it!
Now is totally the Age of Fawful! Definitely!
Find it...please?
But where?
Find it...pretty please?
Gor, you idiot! 300 coins is, like, 60 tasty shroom teas!
This lot will never pay that much! See if I'm wrong!
Say you give us...300 coins? 
No way!
Pay up.

Oy! Like it were nuffing!
Tossing around 300 coins like it ain't no nevermind to 'em!
CELEBRITIES!

Heh...heh...heh... They're quaking in their wee boots, they are...
Hey, brother! Ask 'em for the 300 coins again, hey?
Hey!

We put 'em in invisible blocks so nobody might pinch 'em.
That were right smart, hey? But... Here's the fing, right?
Even we don't remember where we left 'em all!
I mean, they're invisible, hey? No way to see 'em, hey?
Anyway, egg on our faces. But they're in them spots.
I'm finking that you ought to maybe jump around random-like.
Soon enough, BONKO! Hit one!
You're good at jumping, hey?

Heh heh...
Hey? 30 coins ain't much cash at all?
Whaaaat... Hang on. Wait a tick.
Oy... Thems is big time, boyos. 30 coins don't faze 'em a bit.
They look right shabby, but maybe they're celebrities!
Maybe we should be asking for 300 coins or somefing, hey?
Now, a sprinkle of zee Ever Ice...

Today's show is oooooooooover!

Please exit at once!

Awww... It's all over... Super, super weak.
Next time I'll get front row! Next time!
It was great, wasn't it, honey? Lord Fawful's show was sweet as purest honey, honey.
It surely was, darling.
But not as sweet as who I call darling, darling.
You go too far. My honey Boo is sweeter than honey, honey.
Oh, my darling Koopa! You're so darling, darling!

What is it, dear?!
It's Dad! He's...
NOOO! HONEY!
Mom, I'm home!
Well, hi there, sweetie! Home early today, huh?
Ms. Ingletoad just wouldn't stop talking. Blah blah blaaaaaah!
So I snuck out and came home!
You naughty little scamp!
You'll never grow up into a fine Toad with such bad behavior!
Fiiiiiiiiine, Mom, whatever.
So, is dinner ready yet?
Yes, dear, it is.
But call your dad before we eat.
OK!
DAAAAAAD! Dinner's ready!
YEEEEEEK!
Dad?
Now, they have scattered all over the map.
Wendy and Larry were in the castle. No telling what became of them.
See this? Yeah. Save block. You see one, jump to hit it.
Trust me, save whenever you can. Gives you peace of mind.
"Save often, save your sanity."
My uncle used to say that all the time. A wild one, my uncle.
Anyway, it's OK for Luigi to hit blocks too!
Save often! It's crucial!
Head into the conference hall!
The meeting already started!
That intern that just passed by here...
Man, she was cute...
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
Ooog, not the conference hall.
Conference hall is over there!
Definitely here...
Maybe here...
Probably might be over here...
Give it a try anywhere! And remember you can always talk to me if you need help.
You got hammers!
Wow, looks like Bowser inhaled all kinds of junk, huh?
Let's hope some of it turns out to be stuff we can use!
Maybe in this wooden crate... If we could break it open...
I bet you could break all kinds of things with those hammers!
First, you switch the action icon to your hammer with  or ...
And then if you press , you'll swing the hammer!
You just KNOW that'll be useful all over the place!
Try it out!
Oh, and I went ahead and added this action to your guide.
Just open up the star menu to check it out anytime!
Some call me an Emoglobin with save-ish qualities.
I have save-ish qualities, but also disappear-soon-ish ones.
Want to save your globin? 
No.
Yes.
An entry was added to the Guide.
Mario, Luigi, good luck.
Starlow and I will debate what to do next.
What in the world...
VERY FUNNY!
Mario! Luigi! Thank you!
I knew you'd save me.
Listen, Princess Peach... Bowser inhaled everyone. They're all inside his body...
Well, in that case, we must find a way for all of us to escape.
Hmm? You think we might not be able to get back outside?
Well... What to do...
Gosh... Up to now, all I was thinking about was finding Princess Peach...
But now we really need to find a way out of here...
Hey, look! There's another room up ahead.
Maybe just through here! It could be the exit...
Tell you what... I'll guard Princess Peach here.
You two go ahead and see if there's an exit, OK?
There they are! Up there!
Princess Peach is trapped inside! Save her!
Listen, guys... Be careful!
I don't think hammering or jumping will shake them off...
We have to think of some other way to get rid of them...
...Ah!
...You all saved me! Thank you so much!
Mario! Luigi!
THEY'RE COMING BACK!
OK, guys! You stop them!
I'll guard the princess!
What? Luigi, YOU want to guard the princess?
You mean Mario and I should fight those guys?
THE BLORBS!
Mushroom Kingdom Marred by Mystery Malady! The Blorbs!
It comes without warning! First, you balloon to blimp size! Then the rolling! You roll away! Oh, the horror of the blorbs!
As of press time, the cause and cure are unknown...
Day by day, the number of blorbed Toads swells...
Seeing how grave the situation is, Princess Peach convenes an emergency meeting at her castle...

Just jumping's not enough to get these muscles going...
When you land, press the button to stomp really hard!
OK, now Luigi!
Looks like you need to press the button of the bro on the bottom.
If you alternate stomps left and right, you jump higher and stimulate the muscles more.
Time your button presses to keep the jumps going, OK?
Ah!
Looks like you keep stomping by holding the button down...
Maybe you should press and hold those buttons a bit?

Huff... Whuff... What in the-- Legs running by themselves!
Slow down!
Too faaaaaaast!
Noo-WHOOAA!
Really feeling the burn! Smelling the burn too!
Wait... Is that ME?! Am I on FIRE?!
Whoa! My chub layer! It's all burning up! I'm a MACHINE!
BWAHAHAHAHA! Best workout ever!
Hey, now that I think about it, what room is this?
The underground's that way...
Whoa whoa WHOA! What's the deal here?
The passage to the underground is blocked!
Stupid...Fawful...
Caves under construction!
On an unrelated note, a Fawful statue is now on the balcony.
To view it, head out onto the throne room balcony!
You aspire to travel? 
Don't travel.
Travel.
You found a puzzle sack! Take it to Kuzzle!
What in the name of globin? Strange to meet you, O visitor.
Some call me an Emoglobin. Of secret-ish things in the body of Bowser, I know them all.
I can impart this knowledge to you, if you have the globin.
And I have Emoglobin brethren. Hit them, O jump-ish creature.
Being struck bothers us none... for such is the way of globin.
Anyway, O traveler, about what are you curious? The nature of globin? The meaning of globin?
BRZZZZZZZZZT!
I tell you NOTHING!
But I will let you save, since your globin reminds me of me.
Want to save your globin? 
No.
Yes!
By the way, O traveler, like all things in life, I am temporary, so be careful-ish!
Some call me an Emoglobin with save-ish qualities.
I have save-ish qualities, but also disappear-soon-ish ones.
Want to save your globin? 
No.
Yes.

O rule-ish rules, what are you?
The crucial one is to be globin. After that, the questions. You ask Bowser many questions!
I don't mind telling you that his answers and those in the quiz may be very similar-ish.

Say your globin shines forth and you answer everything right! Then you win! I show the way.
But wait, O impatient one. One wrong-ish word halts the train. And I show you NOTHING.
And worse, a penalty lurches forth out of the mists of globin! You'll battle for my pleasure!
Then let the globin begin! Oh, but first...
The questioning... Yes, you ask Bowser questions. He will hear you by the power of globin.
I don't mind telling you that his answers and those in the quiz may be very similar-ish.

I HAVE CHORTLES! And soon, I have your castle! Fawful will love it there!
You will visit, perhaps! Fawful will reserve the Crying Room for the crying for your minions.
And the crying will be like a savory soda for my soul!
NOW I HAVE FURY!
Some fighting will be slowing you!
BOWSER! BOWSER!
CAN'T SEE! FOOT IN FACE!
Oh, man, Bowser... You gotta help us!
Your castle already got hit! It was bad, man. Real bad! Some guy named Fawful...
Just look! He crammed the entire Goomba squadron in a cage and CHUCKED US!
Chucked you?! Goombas don't get chucked, pal!
"Marching straight ahead into the enemy's feet!"
Didn't you memorize that in Goomba boot camp?
It was all real sudden, Boss...
We're unworthy. Not fit for stomping.
Pathetic... So what about the rest of my military?
Did the other corps get spanked as bad as you?
Probably... It was brutal...
BRAAARGH!
I TOLD you to train harder! No wonder Mario crushes you!
Right! And now we take back my castle!
GOO-RAH!
The Goombas joined as minions! Bowser can use Goomba Storm in battle!
I have the weeping! Such a reunion of sobs!
You have moved Fawful with the family drama.
Shut up! And don't mess with my minions!
Only I do that!
But now I have chortle time! Fawful scattered your minions like litter from a sad, ugly cat.
Are you wanting to hear them? For they are on the TV show. The TV show of your tears!
Bowser! Sir! Koopa unit down. Requesting evac!
SOS SOS SOS SOS Bob-omb squad here!
Come in, anyone! Hello? Anyone copying this?
Shy Guy corps reporting. They got us. They got us all.
We're such bad soldiers!
This...STINKS!
MY MINIONS!
UURRGH!
Hey! Don't shove!
Ouch, man! OUCH!
Haaalp!
Can't breathe...
I want my mom!
Hey! You slackers! What are you doing?!
Some nutjob's after my castle!
And you guys are hanging out playing Cram-in-the-Cage?!
BOWSER!
Yeah. Sorry, Boss. Sorry, Bowser.
Well, I'll train you chumps up nice! Follow me!
Oh! Thanks! Sweet!
But... Uh, how do we get off this island, Boss?
I'll make a bridge or something! BECAUSE I GET THINGS DONE.
Yeah, instead of crying all the time, I make things happen!
You did it!
Our hero!
High five!
It's a deal! If you're for real, I'll drink as much as you want!
Bah!
Hey!
What's this thing?
The Sea Pipe Statue? Sounds dumb. What is it?
Ah, a hero, huh? So that means...
IT'S UGLY!
Hmph!
My eyes are much more manly than that!
Whoa! This thing is moving!
...Actually, I am kinda thirsty.
I'm the model!
HEY!
It's some weird statue!
Whoa, what happened? My flame is back!
What?! Really?!
Not too shabby!
I might have to make you an honorary minion!
A statue honoring a hero of the sea.
Hmph! Well, forget I offered. No one needs to know.
What's your name, anyway?
Wait! Wait! No violence!
Yeah. Your name. Give me it.
What?! It's moving? That's not possible!
Chippy? Weird name...
Looks like we have no choice. Let's deal with that statue!
Wait, hang on, Chippy!
Did you just say "we"?
Who else is in there?
Well, whatever.
The only thing that matters is Captain Flame is back, baby!
He's got a fiery temper, but MAN is he a fun dude!
Just a little touch of , and FWAAAARGH!
Anybody standing in the way gets done medium rare!
Maybe I'd better shake the rust off by burning these trees!
I think I drank too much...
Take me to my castle right now!
BWAHAHA!
He seriously thought he could stop Bowser with this toy?
Hey! What's the story with this crazy statue? It's going nuts!
Again?!
That voice!
What's with this water?
OH, YES I AM!
Look, pal, I can tell you wanna fight, but I'm in no mood.
GWAHAHAHA!
Aw, I was all fired up to let Fawful have it!
I'll take you instead!
I HAVE CHORTLES!
It is I who added the nuts to that statue!
Your plan that I laugh at now makes for more laughing! You are wanting your castle?
You are not getting there!
You have the impatience... You must stop and sample the sprinklies in life's salad bar.
I say no to your rushing! Time instead for some playing with a Fawfulized statue!
Bloooooooorg... I feel all...sloshy.
What?
What? No! Why?
What? Filth? CRUST?!
And you... You think you can fix me up in there?
You can get my flame back?!
GWAHAHAHA!
You can make me better than Mario?!
No! Too late! It's Fawful!
Time for the crying! Too badness for you!
For the Dark Star is snuggled with Fawful!
Oooooh... Mario... I'm so sorry...
The Dark Star... is raw evil...
Quickly... You must get it back...
Peach has been captured... The Dark Star is freed...
If this keeps up, the Mushroom Kingdom is done for!
Yeah! We must return the Dark Star before its seal breaks!
Mario... Fawful said he... was off to take control of Peach's Castle!
That door up there leads straight to Toad Town... You have to hurry...
The beauty hurts my teeth! Such power of darkness!
My spine has the tingle!
Are you wanting to see it? Fawful's new Dark Star?
You look! Such badness! Such pitch-black power!
Fawful sings a song of bad!♪ Mushroom Kingdom is so sad!♪
All of it is for Fawful!♪ And the...rhyme with...that.♪
It is Fawful day! Joys! Be trembling before me!
All who resist will be beat like naughty little eggs!
I HAVE CHORTLES!
GAHAHAHA!
That all you got, train?! Bowser wins again!
So...
What was I doing?
That's right! The Star Cure!
Better go check that safe back at the castle...
Doh.

He crawls up like a Koopa. Such is Bowser's courage.
Koopa?
You rang?
I DID NOT!
Bowser! Next time, I punch your thigh bone, your eye bone, and your dry bone!
Dry Bone?
Ummmm... Did you call...
NO!
Thought not...
My Lord Midbus! Bowser approaches!
MUH MUH!
The clock strikes payback hour.
Do plan two. To your posts!
Roger!
Lord Fawful is in here! We must protect him!
Trouble, Lord Midbus! There's a Banzai Bill on course for the castle!
The trajectory suggests a Dimble Wood launch!
What? Will it hit the castle?
That smell again...
Mmm... Best smell ever...
AAAH! GAAH!
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
Cliff is to west!
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
FYI! FYI! FYI! FYI!
Cliff is to west!
FYI! FYI!
Do you need to hurry and find the third cure? You do.
The third sage is atop a high cliff!
That's a bit too much practice eating, no?
When you eat a piece of carrot that holds that enzyme, it flashes briefly. 
A mouth flash means pay close attention to the swallowed bit.
For inside that piece hides the digestive enzyme.
This is what tiny super-digestive enzymes look like.
Yes, yes, yes. Practice is over...
If you delete random pieces, the enzyme fades to blue and grows ever weaker.
Go, face-stuff challenge!
This giga-carrot includes a super-digestive enzyme that quickly digests food.
Ah, these tiny enzymes hide within other pieces as well...
Ah.
Use it while it is red, and all eaten food will be digested at once.
Ready?

Yes, sir! Shoo-rah!
All systems go for launch!
So... What was the plan with the cannon, huh, guys?
Just light that fuse and BOOM! ZOOM! BONK!
Oh! We were, uh, gonna aim it at your castle, and, y'know... Launch it! And then...bonk!
About time! I'll just give it the old flame treatment.
Watch carefully, minions! This is how you get it done!
Sir, the bonking to which he refers is on the enemy heads!
What?!
Those guys didn't seem too reliable.
Hey! Backseat minion manager! I was GONNA look, OK?
Hoff... Haff... Hfuhruhurr... It's... It's no good, guys... My back... I tweaked it...
Get it together, Private Goomp! Let's scout the area, at least.
I wonder what everyone else is doing right now...
I bet they're hurting bad. I mean, you guys were there. That scene was GNARLY.
Think we're the only ones who escaped?
Yeah... I bet we are... Boy... That was just plain mean!
Who plans an attack for when Bowser's not there?
Ugh... If only Bowser were here, he'd know what to do...
Bowser, man... Where are you? And what are you doing?
Hey! Minions!
Uh, what? Call me crazy, but it looks like Bowser Castle is heading this way!
Niiiice! Not a bad idea for a bunch of minions!
I'm on board with it! Launch away!
WHAAT?!
Uh... But... We... That...
We can't... launch now.
To be frank, sir, we appear to be lacking ammunition...
Yeah, lemme just jump in here and add that I forgot to bring the Banzai Bill for the cannon.
IDIOTS!
Wow, why am I not surprised?! Look, chumps, if we don't have a Banzai Bill, go find one!
We must've launched hundreds of 'em at Mario over the years. There must be one around!
You got it, Boss! We'll find a Banzai Bill right away!
So, uh... So where are they at, again?
I told you to find one because I don't know where they are!
Yikes! Right away, Boss! We'll find one! Be right back!
Hey! Why don't YOU go look for one?
He's stubborn...
Selfish...
Possibly unfit for duty. Huge head, tiny brain...
Find anything?
Nothing...
BOWSERRRRR!
No way there's a Banzai Bill in the forest...
So... My castle got taken over, huh?
That Fawful weirdo wasn't joking, then...
Great... As always, a Bowser plan goes totally off the rails...
Yeah... It... Well, this weird duo just showed up and went nuts.
Huge attack, and just like that, they had the castle...
He does lack strategy...
Uh-huh, we were doing a, uh, tactical retreat, and we grabbed this cannon to maybe use...
You're useless! Now move it! Load up the Banzai Bill!
GWAHAHA!
Bowser always comes through!
Good stuff! And don't worry! We'll get my castle back!
OK, Bowser! The Banzai Bill is loaded up!
Welcome, good to see you!
All customers are welcome at this gear shop!

Hmmmm, strange... Zee world, it appears to be upside down...
But zat is no matter. You 'elped me, and for zis I salute you!
Enough blabbing, buddy! Make with the surprise block!
Ah, but of course! Zee block! From moi! Such a fine block! We sing the song of block!
Pour vous!
You got the Vacuum Block!
OH YEAH! FEEL IT!
This is just a normal block! No surprise! What gives?!
Your tongue, bite upon it! Non! Zat LOOKS like a normal block!
Zat is what is so devious about my little block. So devious!
Zis is actually a Vacuum Block. You hit zis block, and you inhale whatever lies before you!
Say you use zis in battle, honh? Ah! What is zis?! You inhale zee enemy with bravado! Très bien!
Whoa, whoa, INHALE an enemy?! I can do that in a battle?
Ah, but of course, it is simple! Come, let us try zis out!
You! You will submit to zee power of zis magnificent block, and you will do so NOW!
Ah, how was zis? Nice, honh? Zee magnificent Vacuum Block! Zee color! Zee gloss! Zee feel!
We are not worthy of zis block! Who dares say zis is not so?
And you, Monsieur Turtle Bits, you become a block collector after seeing zis block, oui?
Alors, let us meet again, honh? Until zen, good-byes to you!
Taste your fist? Ha ha. I think not.
I HAVE NO TASTE!
That doesn't even make sense!
Sense is for the weak!
You listen. Peach, gone. Lord Fawful, new ruler.
Now, no need of you. Lord Fawful says sleep.
NOW YOU SLEEP!
GAAAAAAAAAAAH!
What is WRONG with you?! Nothing you say makes sense!
And now you made me mad!
And once I get mad, I need to punch something! C'MERE!
Muh muh muh.
You are weak. Most weak.
Pffffft. Please! Get over yourself!
My castle's gonna be just fine, pal.
Hmm... We will be seeing...
Anyway, I thought you would be sleeping long, like a lazy bear.
And I am thinking you should be sleeping more!
COME! MIDBUS!
What... How...
It does not end here. Work on your skills.
Hey! You in the gut! Are you listening?!
I hear you!
Sounds like Fawful is taking over!
I'm heading for my castle!
Huh? No, that's no good! Go to Peach's Castle!
We HAVE to go to Peach's Castle!
What am I, a taxi? Want a coffee too? Maybe a massage?
Look, my castle's in danger!
We gotta head there right now! That weirdo can't have it!
...OK, I understand. Do as you must.
No one mocks Bowser and gets away with it...
I'm just out of sorts, that's all.
I gotta pound some pipsqueaks and get my level back to a Bowser-worthy number!
Hey! HEY! COME BACK! I'm not done with you!
HRRRGH!
You. No longer needed. Here, you taste defeat.
Taste defeat? You're gonna taste my fist, you little piglet!
This place...
Will you wait a moment?
What the...
This can't be...
Yeah! It must be!
Sorry for the wait.
I found something up ahead that bugs me.
It's faster to show you than to bother explaining.
Head in there!
Something bugs me in the back of this area.
Go check it out!
That protrusion sticking out of the nerve in the back...
I think if we stimulate it, something'll happen...
A cave?
This is just weird...
He doesn't remember inhaling us at all...
He doesn't know where he is right now...
What happened up there?
Hey, up there! First, shouldn't you find a way out of that cave?
Let's let Bowser do his thing for a while.
This! This is the thing! This sticking-out part...
It seems to be connected to Bowser's major nerve.
If we can stimulate this thing, something'll happen...
That got him up.
HEY! HEAR ME?
Don't bother looking!
I'm actually down here! Inside your body!
You don't remember? At Peach's Castle...?
Oh... You don't?
This is really lucky. Let's not tell him yet that he inhaled us.
Maybe I should explain who I am later...
It's a long story...
Oh... Uh, really? Weird.
Listen, to change the subject, uh, where are you right now?
You got the red key!
テスト
What are you interested in? 
Viewing the map. 
Resetting the action icon. 
Practicing Bros. Attacks. 
Starting battles well. 
Other info. 
Never mind!
Welcome! I've found some really awesome gear down here!
OK, say you feel completely lost, by boogity...
Go ahead and open up the map and you can scope out your current location.
You oughta be able to orient yourself at a glance.
What's more, the map is great for locating Attack Pieces.
If you're in the midst of an Attack Piece collectathon, use your map, by boogity!
...Hey, and by the way, you can scroll the map with  or your stylus!
Try it out and see!
Ah... Mr. Mario... Uh... Well... See... The thing is...
Toadbert was gonna brief you on his current investigation of Bowser's body, but...
He went off on some errand, and he never came back...
Oh man, I'm really worried... What could've happened...
OK, say you use  or  to switch the action icon to the hammer or something...
If you wanna just go back to the main jump icon, what you wanna do is press and  together.
Yeah, pressing  and  together always takes you back to jump.
You want to jump, reset that icon with and , by boogity! Super convenient, trust me!
The wags have it that if you drill into odd spots in the earth and pop out, you find beans.
And the rumor is, if one uses these mysterious beans...
One will grow a little bit! In a statistical sense, so to speak.
What's more, they're packed with plant protein, so they're really quite healthy!
I highly suggest you find such beans for daily health and sound statistical growth!
WHERE ARE YOU, TOADBERT?!
He's gotta be in Bowser's body somewhere, but...
I hope he gets back soon...
OK, so sometimes you attack a monster, and all of a sudden you see Lucky! appear...
That shows that your attack power was stronger than usual!
The higher your STACHE points (or Bowser's HORN points), the more lucky attacks you see!
Raise your STACHE and HORN stats to improve your luck and make battles less scary!
Ah, Mario and Luigi. How goes it?
I've gathered some info for you. Wanna hear it? 
Later...
Sure do!
OK, so some monsters are weak against fire, right?
Well, attack a monster vulnerable to fire with a fire-type attack, and you'll get critical hits!
You see a fire-hating monster, immediately unload with a fire attack, by boogity!
Thing is...make sure the thing really is weak against fire. It depends on the monster...
OK, so when you level up, you choose whatever stat you like and add bonus points to it...
But let's say you keep adding points to the same stat...
 Well, then you'll see only low numbers appearing in the rolling-number slot.
If you start seeing only low numbers, best choose another stat, by boogity!
Get some balance, and the numbers will go back to normal.
I'm elated to find the others, but I fear for the princess...
Find her with all speed! I beg of you!
Oh, hey, guys, listen up a sec. I've been having a weird dream.
In the dream, I'm drinking tea in a small room, and time is passing really, really slowly...
Then from somewhere I hear  being pressed...
Then time starts passing quickly instead, by boogity!
Really weird dream, I know... ...
Hey, sorry for sharing that. Wanna hear some info? 
Later...
Listen.
MASTER MARIO! MASTER LUIGI! I heard the dreadful news!
The puh-puh-princess!
Puh-Puh-Puh-Peach!
Puh-puh-puh-PBBBBLTH!
Some base fiend has gone and snatched her from us!
My frazzled nerves can't bear any more wretched news!
10 coins for 2 frosty ones. What do you say? Thirsty?
Oh, but wait... Both of you have maximum HP and BP...
Why don't you come back once you lose some HP or BP, OK?
OK, on the Guide menu, you can check battle tutorials and practice your attacks.
The demo is fully automatic, so it's fine if you just want to kick back and watch!
Me? I'd advise you to practice attacks you rarely use...or ones you're really bad at!
PRINCESSSSS!
Noooo...
And it's on sale right now! What a great time to be thirsty!
For a limited time only, it's just 1 coin for 2 frosty ones. What do you say? Thirsty? 
 Nah...
Juice me!
What are you interested in? 
Distributing bonus points. 
About lucky hits. 
About critical hits. 
Back to other info. 
Nothing.
OK, so when you touch an enemy, battle begins, right?
But the fact is, the WAY you touch an enemy changes the way the battle begins!
Say you jump on an enemy from above to start a battle...
Well, guess what? You'll damage that enemy at the start of the battle, by boogity!
Hammer an enemy to start a battle, and it's the same deal.
Whether you cause a little damage or a lot, it'll give you an advantage, so give it a try.
Oh, but hey, by the way...
If you start a battle by jumping on an enemy with spikes or horns, YOU'LL take damage.
Be careful, by boogity!
Master Mario... Master Luigi... I stand before you a new man.
Indeed, I've no cause to mope. The princess will be all right!
You young masters will doubtless come to her aid, so I shan't worry anymore.
In fact, to support you two gents, I've been rather busy!
Indeed, I've been cannily snooping about for information.
Care to hear some juicy bits? 
Maybe later...
Sure!
And it's on sale right now! What a great time to be thirsty!
For a limited time only, it's just 1 coin for 2 frosty ones. What do you say? Thirsty?
Oh, but wait... Both of you have maximum HP and BP...
Why don't you come back once you lose some HP or BP, OK?
I've been within Bowser's body since the fiend inhaled me...and I've grown rather used to it!
It really might do well as a bit of a summer retreat...
Or perhaps the capital city! Gracious me! The very idea!
I'll stop spouting drivel now. Care for some real information? 
Nah...
Please!
Ah! Mr. Mario! Welcome!
You and Mr. Luigi both got inhaled by Bowser too, huh?
I'm relieved, actually. With you in here, I don't feel so scared!
Hey, but listen, have you seen these things called Emoglobins living inside Bowser's body?
There are all kinds. They're all a little weird, to be honest.
But get this! The one behind me sweats! And it doesn't sweat sweat, it sweats juice!
Sounds gross, I know! But drink it, and your energy wells up and fully restores your condition!
...It's an acquired taste.
Mr. Mario! And Mr. Luigi!
You guys also got inhaled!
Phew! That's kind of a relief! With you guys in here, we might actually have a shot.
What? All the others?
I think all the Toads Bowser inhaled are gathered here...
Folks are doing what they can. Y'know, scavenging stuff from inside Bowser, opening shops...
...Problem is, this isn't exactly a high-traffic shopping zone.
Everyone got pretty antsy, sitting around doing nothing...
Opening up these shops was a nice diversion, y'know?
So c'mon, you guys, give us a lift and buy something, huh?
Me, I'm gonna go scout around and see if I can't find some more useful stuff.
Hey! Mr. Mario! Nice seeing you! I was pretty freaked at first, landing in this creepy place...
But we'll all find a way out of here. I'm just sure of it!
Speaking of which, I've got all these items I gathered for you, so how about you buy a few?
Welcome! If you see anything you need, go ahead and buy it.
Hey! Mr. Mario! Nice seeing you!
I'm patting myself on the back right now, because I figured you guys got inhaled too.
That's why I gathered a bunch of supplies for you! So smart!
Sorry I have to charge for it, but you know how it is with cost of labor and such...

Drilling into suspicious spots in the ground and popping out produces beans, as you know.
And I imagine you also know that using beans augments your statistical categories, yes?
Well, the categories you can develop depend on the bean.
Heart Beans develop your HP. Special Beans up your BP.
Power Beans develop your POW to increase your attack power.
So please! If you find beans, use them straightaway!

O globins, are you collecting those Attack-ish Pieces?
My soul weeps for those who seek Attack Pieces here...
For woe be to the traveler who consults the useless map!
It helps not at all! Oh, the globin of it ravishes the soul!
One must instead use all one's experience to root out the pieces' hidey-holes!
And then one must globin!
O impressive ones, you've found all Energy Hold Attack Pieces!
One word for you: globin!
O reflector wall that rears up before this globin...
Your bright-light reflections block our view of the other side.
How can we see through? The answer is clear as globin.
What's not clear is how to make it clear. Do you know?
GWAHAAA!
Talk about a huge veggie!
Not bad! If this is all we got, then veggie ammo it is!
Whoa, that is really big. Might not fit in the cannon...
STOP, THIEF!
The great giga-carrot! Raised by Wigglers for generations!
That giga-carrot was grown by my grandfather's grandfather's...
grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's...
grandfather's generation and every single one since!
And you yanked it!
Hey, giant talking bug!
You seen a Banzai Bill around here anywhere?
...You don't care about the story of the Wigglers at all, huh?
So, a Banzai Bill? I have one.
HOOORG!
C'MON! HNNGH!
Hmmph... OK, fine! Got any hot sauce?
I'm awfully sorry. Will you give up?
Or perhaps take the challenge once more?
Don't you worry, we have plenty of delicious carrots...
By the way, there's a time limit.
Well then. Time's up.
You have one minute to eat it. All of it.
Think of it as a sort of challenge.
WHAT?! That's...really fast! Lemme taste it first.
I'm afraid not.
I hate veggies! What if I scarf this down and get a bellyache?
I'm not signing on for that!
I suppose that's fair. You may have a taste.
But just a little one.
Well then...
Sponsored by the Wiggler family! Promoted by the Wiggler family! Authorized by the very same!
We bring to you, live, the game of Giga-carrot, which nourishes nature, body, and soul!
Oh, I'm awfully sorry. Will you give up?
Or perhaps take the challenge once more?
I'll provide a giga-portion of normal carrots...
ミニゲーム失敗

Ouchouchouchouch...
I can't bear it if you damage the rest of our organic crops...
Please, just take this and leave our property!
You got a Banzai Bill!
We can use the cannon now!
A Wiggler will await you here until you take responsibility, even if it takes generations.
What?! Awesome!
Yes, a long time ago, a Banzai Bill fell into the pasture...
I have secretly cared for it, telling no one where it lies.
Do you want it?
Yes! Gimme!
Oh, of course, I would, but... You really need to learn a lesson or two about honor.
So first of all, you need to take responsibility for yanking out this giga-carrot.
Then we can talk Banzai Bill.
Responsibility?!
You heard me! The Wiggler family has been growing this for ages! Growing this huge giga-carrot!
Now take responsibility...
I must avenge the Wigglers whose legacy you sullied!
You must be removed from our farm like compost!
AND EAT IT!
Bah! You like compost? I'll compost your FACE!
When you yank a vegetable out, be responsible and eat it all.
That's been Wiggler law since time out of mind. Waste not!
Eat THAT?! It's huge!
Fine, don't. But no Banzai Bill.
No carrot defeats me!
Take the challenge? 
Once more! 
Give up!
You've not taken responsibility.
Take the face-stuff challenge? 
Let's stuff! 
Not right now.
Well, just calm down. Don't panic, don't panic.
First, you should save. Take a deep breath.
Want to go save? 
Yeah, I should. 
No! Banzai Bill now!
Here goes! Chow time!
I can't believe it! An eating record!
And what a time! Just  seconds!
Save to be on the safe side. Yes, go slow and steady.
Don't rush. Breathe deep. 
Take a deep breath. 
Get Banzai Bill NOW!
How very splendid.
Let's have a round of applause for Bowser.
...Not that anyone saw all that.
It's all good! Banzai Bill me!
Hey! I took responsibility! Gimme my Banzai Bill!
What? What do you mean? What were we talking about?
Don't start, pal! We had a deal!
You invade our peaceful farm and contaminate it!
You yank our giga-carrot! And then you EAT it!
Now face Wiggler's wrath!
You TOLD me to eat it, you idiot!
Not too shabby! I can use this!
...What do I do?
You, uh... Uhhhh...
The machine's light renders the insides of one's body visible!
My proprietary laser emits Boo transparency waves, giving the light its special properties.
If you wish to see, stand upon the marked platform before it.
Stand upon the marked platform in front of the Boo-ray machine.
Yes... Boo...
That which appears even as one thinks it disappears...
A mirage, ephemeral, like the gulf betwixt dreams and waking.
Hey! Can you hear me?! You can do body slams!
First, you switch actions with , by boogity!
Then, press  to jump, and press  again to drop! That's all!
And you are?
OH NO! I mean, no, not at all! Uh, by boogity!
I think I'm catching a cold! Koff! Haaaack! Ptooie!
Yuck! Uh... Ahem! Sorry. Yeah, just a cold...
What's with this book? It's totally blank...
Who are you, bub?! You LIVE in there?!
What? You don't know me? ME?!
Yeah, I... I told you I did! It's tough...but I'll soldier on!
Anyway, maybe you should try that move out around there?
You got THAT right, buddy! I'm Bowser, the Koopa king!
Boo?
Boo-ray what?
OOOOOOH!
What's going on?! That feels GREAT!
Feels like power is building in my abs!
Who has awakened me from my eternal slumber?
I am called Yikk.
Master creator. Bonded genius. Inventor of the Tower of Yikk.
Whoa! It's like a spotlight for my gut!
Hey! My body feels...not right! What's going on in there?
My physical body no longer treads the paths of this world.
My soul slumbers in this book, my entire existence distilled into a patchwork of dreams...
But you are not of dreams. You are no ordinary being, are you?
Chippy?! What was that? Body slams?
I see...
Huh. Yeah.
And...are you one tormented by the ageless riddle of Boo?
Let's slam something.
That which disappears even as one thinks it appears...
GAHAHA!
I am tormented by the riddle of the Boo.
In this place, I have researched their ways.
I did it! Chippy! That was awesome!
And the result is...
I've wasted enough time! To Dimble Wood!
This Boo-ray Machine!
Wait! Body slam...
An entry was added to the Guide.
There are a bunch of places I could use it, I think...
Better go try it out.
Behold! Your body is transparent!
In layman's terms, yes. Well? Amazing, isn't it?
Makes one feel like saying, "Wow, that Yikk!" Right?
This marks the first usage of the Boo-ray on a living being...
I consider the trial a success. Now, to sleep and dream again.
Use it all you wish.

I figured out the blorbs cure. Yeah, what I did was make the house into a sauna.
Super hot. Yup, you just sweat those blorbs out! So don't douse the fire.
Whuff whuff whuff! Whuff whuff whuff!
Sweat the blorbs out! Whuff whuff whuff!
Hey! Mario!
Check me out! I'm cured!
They say the blorbs have been cured!
Whoa! You found me! Mario, you're amazing!
OK, I'm hiding again! So... Here I goooo!
Hey, how're you doing? Shopping for items, huh?
What?! I lost AGAIN?! Does anybody EVER win with these bonus cards?
Oh, young Master! You finally understand...
*sniffle* I always knew it.
I knew you cared for us all deep down in your heart!
Kamek...
Hey! Don't get crazy!
It's not like I wanna be friends with them or anything!
Yes, young Master?
Oh, yes, of course. That makes sense.
They got lucky! I want a rematch!
I'm starving.
Hey! Stop smiling!
Oh, Lizzy! My sweet granddaughter! I'm so happy to see you again!
Wait... It WAS Lizzy, wasn't it?
Or are you Britt? Stacy? No, Danielle! Anna?  No, Corrine...  Darcy?
Let's go find 'em right now. This is gonna be a blowout!
Right! No more smiling. All done with the smiling.
Shall we go? Are you ready to go find the Koopalings?
Uh, how many grandchildren do you have?!
Now, they have scattered all over the map.
Wendy and Larry were in the castle. No telling what became of them.
Sounds like they're looking for Ludwig.
I don't trust 'em, but it's a lead...
Translation: I'd rather stay with you, grandfather. I cherish my life here.
Didja see? My sweet Bernadette went off to Dimble Wood.
I advise these gentlemen to kindly take their leave of us.
Bernadette?
That's a totally different name than Lizzy!
Huh? Oh, maybe it wasn't Bernadette...
Was it Scarlet? Harriet... Juliet... Juliette?
Wait. He has granddaughters named Juliet AND Juliette?!
...You know what? Never mind. Let's just go get Ludwig.
Translation: What are you gents talking about? I don't understand what you're saying to me.
Amber?
What's goin' on here, Charlie?
Tabitha?
... *sniffle*
Yes, of course! Coming.
Charlie?
Umm... Iggy's been gone for, like, a day.
Oh, man...
You have a point. I wonder how long this Kuzzle fellow thinks it has been...
They what? Lessee. Hey, tots! How do ya know young Charlie here?
Hey, gramps! Who's Charlie, and what have you done to Iggy?!
What now? Oh, this is a certified pickle.
What say we head to my shack and have ourselves a good old-fashioned blab session?
Y'see, just the other day I moseyed my way over to the beach for some sunnin'.
That's about when I saw my Charlie boy marooned.
Yes, young Master?
Yep, Charlie here is my grandson. He just lost his memory, that's all.
All he could say was, "Where am I?" And also, "Who am I?"
My princely promise! Do you remember it?
Your promise? Let me think...
Translation: Hello, Kuzzle, my dear friend!
The promise I made to save all the Minions.
What do you cats want, anyhow?
These two gentlemen claim they have some business to settle with me.
Oh! Right. Yes, of course!
I'm just lookin' to wet my whistle, y'see?
Translation: I'm not certain I trust their motives!
You'll be my witness!
Watch as I keep my promise! And then some!
I gotta stay sharp and salty. So if ya can't help me out, I got no use for ya.
Young Master...
Ya gettin' the transmission?
My magic, um, doesn't work like that...
...Did you just say shock therapy?
Sure! Oh, a little bit never hurt no one. It's a standard cure fer amnesia, really.
So we just...shock him? Then what?
Young Master, with all due respect...you simply cannot beat them by yourself.
Let's try fighting him instead! He'll remember that!
Says you.
I'm not sure about any of this...
Let me ask you this. Do you think Lord Bowser could defeat that group?
Well...yeah. Of course he could.
Dad's the strongest and best at everything!
So, I suppose we'll give the hermit crabs a go.
I wonder how they taste... Savory? Chewy?
Would young Master like them boiled...or grilled? Hmm...
Lord Bowser is mighty, there's no question.
However, his real power lies with the Minions.
Oh. I wonder if they know we're planning on eating them...
Yeah... It's weirding me out.
Those clowns? Come on.
HELLLLP!
Hey, gramps! Listen up!
Think about it. The Minions ADORE Lord Bowser.
If he so wished, they would jump through fire or into the deepest ocean.
Now, what do you think inspires that devotion? Do they simply fear him?
No, it's much more powerful than that. Only love and admiration can inspire such loyalty.
*whew* Those crabs were small, but they sure knew how to work as a team...
People...adore me...
...Working as a team...
Come again?
Um...
Hey! Kamek!
Huh? Who's Charlie?
Yes, young Master?
Hmm...
I don't much like the idea of my boy never rememberin' his buds.
We need to get his rememberins back so he can decide what'll make him happiest.
Our time together ended too soon, but I'll always treasure it.
Please remember to come visit your grandpappy every now and again.
Those're some good buddies you got. You take good care of 'em.
We gotta go! Now!
That right? Friends, you say? True buds, as it were?
Lessee here... How about we try a bit o' shock therapy?
You think they're my buddies?
Well, my brain is still a bit addled, so I'll go with it.
Catch ya on the flipside, daddio! Bahaha!
My grandson... My Charlie boy... I blinked and he grew up on me.
He's...not fully cured, is he...
Iggy rejoined your squad!
Well then. Young Master! Next, we should...
Hey! It's them!
Beef!
Are you SURE Ludwig is here?
...Are you serious?!
Yes, yes, of course you're serious...
Very well. I'll go find you something to eat...
Larry! Iggy!
Lemmy! Ludwig!
Roy! Wendy!
Even Morton!
Stop talking like that! You should be saying "Bahaha"!
C'mon, Iggy. Snap out of it!
Ludwig?
We'll find them all!
Heya, sweet potato! Can ya sling me a sarsaparilla?
Kamek! Use your magic and cure his amnesia!
Huh? Isn't that...
Lizzy? That's my Lizzy girl!
Wheeee!
Where should we start?
Translation: Hello, miss. I am thirsty and in search of a refreshing beverage.
We'll just...find them, that's all! We'll look everywhere!
Iggy!
It's really you! Where have you been?
Um...
IGGY! We're talking to you!
The whole Mushroom Kingdom! We'll check every corner!
Heh...I see, young Master.
That plan is so very...you.
What does THAT mean? You got a better idea?!
What...is WRONG with you?
No way, gramps! This beach is aces.
...No. I really don't. I shall, of course, go with you.
Iggy! Stop this nonsense right now. We need you to come with us!
It's been a real fizz- pop summer, ain't it?
These wet rags can go chase themselves!
So? What are we waiting for? I'm leaving NOW!
I ain't buyin' what you gigglemugs are sellin'.
What? Oh, yes, Charlie.
Time really does fly.
Pauline?
Come what may...
My allegiance is pledged to Lord Bowser and the young Master as long as I live.
*sigh* ...I have a few regrets.
Hey, Goombas!
What's going on here? You two just met!
Julietta?
KAMEK! Hurry up!
Hello...friends?
Grrrr!
Nope. Not friends after all.
They're ready!
It's time! Brute Force Minions!
Go forth and lay waste to the Mushroom Kingdom!
These Goombas are acting like Morton was...
GWAH!
Translation: I'm speaking with the wait staff at this fine establishment. Please leave me alone.
Poor Charlie mostly forgot how to speak. I've been teachin' him.
I made sure he knew how to talk "hip." Like all the young hepcats talk.
I was feelin' quite lonely here, what with bein' all alone.
I'm glad my grandson came on home. I can't imagine life without him now.
Aha! There you are!
Hey, Kamek!
Translation: My previously stated endeavor requires my full attention.
Well, that confirms it. Poor Iggy has amnesia.
Thank goodness you're all right.
Translation: Please understand.
What's that, now?
How do you tots know my Charlie boy?
I'm sorry... I didn't find anything. There's only sea and sand for miles.
Unless...do you think hermit crabs are edible?
Iggy is our—
Young Master... Oh.
He's our friend!
*sniffle* My tears are the perfect seasoning... Weird.
Kuzzle! What's the scoop, chuckles? 
It really is too burnt. Stupid Morton...
I think these jokesters are tryin' to start somethin'.
You think they're on the trolley?
'Cause I'm about ready to fix 'em a knuckle sandwich with extra pepper!
What? No. Stop right there.
Your eyes say it all. I catch what yer throwin'.
Urghhh... My head...
Charlie, my boy! What say you?
Do you wanna go back to your buddies?
Kamek? What happened? Where are we?
Well, I'm not sure. Some sort of beach, obviously.
Those fitness monsters knocked us both out and threw us into the sea.
With the help of a Malatone- addled Morton, sadly.
We must have washed ashore here.
Wait. You're saying... I lost a fight?
You're not wrong...but it will be you who is blown out.
WHAT did you just say to me?! Choose your next words carefully!
Come on, Iggy! Time to remember!
Ugh... What's going on?
What happened?
Iggy! Are you yourself again?
I don't know... Am I?
Bahaha!
HOORAY! Iggy's really back! He's got his crazy laugh again!
Oh. It's you guys!
What are we doing here? Let's go get that onion thing!
DOUBLE HOORAY!
His memories are back too!
It's just... Well, they... They might be beaten up real bad.
They might be crying and in trouble and stuff, just waiting for me to rescue them...
Psst. Young Master...
I can't believe that worked.
The Koopalings and the Minions are your allies. You should consider treating them with respect.
So...I guess...as their future king, I've gotta go help them.
This old man...
He seems...slightly confused.
What were you saying about my memories? I lost them?
Bahaha! That's great!
Young Master. Look around.
S-so they can see how strong I am with their own eyes!
Well, Charlie...I knew this day'd come. I wish you the best of luck, my boy.
Do you see any friends? How about the Koopalings?
Think back. As far as you can. Have you ever done so?
I see. Um, if you'll recall what I said before...
I'm afraid you can't beat those three by yourself.
I...know that now. That's why we're gonna go find the others!
Is this it?
Yes, young Master. You must stand in front of the door.
It was designed to open for no one but your father...or you.
Go on. Enter.

Got cold, huh...
That icy breath Bowser inhaled really dropped the temperature in this area...
Huh? The water froze?
Interesting...
That means you can jump on that platform without it sinking.
Using that icy breath to freeze and melt things will help out, so keep that in mind.

Wait, 6,000 coins for GLOVES?! I can't begin to afford that!
Dear customer, did you not notice the hand stitching? Hm? That price is a bargain.
This store has assembled the finest goods made of hard-to-find materials.
I believe you'll find all of our stock to be magnificent and reasonably priced.
Looking for the changing room? It's right here.
*sigh* Don't worry, everyone. I got this. Hey! Captain Goomba!
Hey! It's Roy!
Yo, Roy! Sorry for being a jerk earlier. Looks like you crushed all these Minions, huh?
That's what they said. Too bad it all sounds like nonsense to me.
I could totally do a better job than those clowns...
I'm gonna get this done myself. Dad would love that!
I've heard of the Giga-Carrot. It's supposed to be in Dimble Wood. Let's go check it out!
I'll just, uh...stay here, I guess. You know...hold down the fort.
Guys! Your plan is garbage. I have a better one!
Wait till they see what I've got in mind...
Mechakoopa! My precious!
Fly! Fly now!
Hey! I'm talking to you! Are you giving me the silent treatment or what? I said I was sorry!
Uh...
MORTON GUARD LORD JUNIOR.
We're the best! C'mon, give it up for the minions!
Let's get crazy!
Why am I the only one dancing?
ROY! What's wrong with you?!
Great work getting the recipe for Skeletone Formula:D, Roy.
So, we need something called a "Giga-carrot," an "Omega-onion," and some "Ever Ice."
Lord Junior...we need to get out of here. Let's move Roy to somewhere safe.
With those ingredients in hand, we can cure the blorbs!
Oh...great.
Are your troops ready?
Sir, yes, sir! I have the minions in position, locked and loaded.
Excellent. You may go.
Give Lord Junior a true test...
SIR, YES, SIR!
What's all that about? Were you gonna fill us in?
In times like these, we can't leave things to chance.
I've simply arranged for Lord Junior to learn a few lessons.
After all, we wouldn't want him to get hurt, would we?
If you manage to teach that kid something, you'll be the first!
Well, in real battles, he'll have to learn.
When I came to, I was here at the castle. I had made it...somehow...
Yeah...
テスト
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
Mario! Luigi! Blast this one together, OK?
Press and hold both buttons, and keep blasting that thing!
His energy sparked!
His energy spiked!
Bowser's moving again!
His energy sparked!
His energy spiked!
Bowser's moving again!
OK, so how do we ford this adrenaline channel, anyway?
OK, yeah, that's adrenaline!
Because it's red adrenaline, Mario, you have to blast it!
Use that beam to blast the adrenaline as it flies at you.
That next one's green, Luigi!
Fire from the left!
When you blast adrenaline, it fills that adrenameter!
When the adrenameter gets completely filled...
Maybe Bowser's energy gets revived by adrenaline!
Mario, hit the red! Luigi, hit the green! Don't mix it up!
If adrenaline hits the boat of revival, you'll lose a heart.
Don't let that adrenaline hit the boat, OK?!
What's THAT?!
I think a single shot won't repel that adrenaline...
Skip minigame and proceed with story? 
No 
Yes
-Fire-Extinguishing Water- Not for drinking!
If you happen to drink some, have someone hammer your back so you spit it out!
Lord Bowser! Are you OK?
Lord Bowser!
Larry! Lemmy!
Oh! Lord Junior!
Watch out, Lord Junior! We're in trouble here!
Lord Bowser got squashed by this giant beast!
WHAT?!
Whoaaaa!
Lord Junior!
It's not safe here! We've gotta go!
Psst... Who is that over there?
Dr. Toadley's intern.
Hmm...
Well, I have many patients, so you'll have to excuse me.
Blast... Doctors are stumped... The Star Sprite is helpless...
To whom might we turn?
Look, I'm really sorry, OK?
There are some things that even a Star Sprite can't do!
I guess we just give up, huh?
Hmph! How insolent!
Both of you... Calm down.
Yeah, what's wrong with you, Toadsworth?!
There IS someone we can count on, by boogity!
Oh! Quite right!
Hope endures!
Did someone just page the king of awesome?
PEACH!
What are you doing here?!
We're in an important meeting! The kingdom's in danger!
MAAARIO!
Gee, PARDON ME! Guess what? I live here, Your Royal Genius!
I've got as much right to be in this meeting as anyone!
I mean, right? Help me out here! Toadsworth! Back me up!
That... Erm... That's... Well...
Don't be ridiculous! You have no right to be here! Get out!
Crud!
Are you seriously trying to start with me again?!
I hear about this big meeting, and I'm all ready to act nice...
But man, the second I see your face, Mr. Nice Bowser is GONE.
Yeah, forget your dumb meeting! I'll pummel you and grab Peach!
What...happened...
Where are my skills? That was not my "A" game...
I mean, I've lost before, but not THAT easily...
HWAAAAAARF!
Gwa ha ha...ah...ha...haaf...
Princess... This thing is...what?
I HAVE VICTORY! Easy as bread sandwiches!
And now for the proceeding with the plan I have planned!
Nice to meet you! I'm Starlow!
Peach sent word of trouble in the Mushroom Kingdom...
So, as a representative of the Star Sprites, here I am!
Midbus! Come!
Fawful calls you!
HELLO YELLO!
Of course... Lord Fawful...
Mercy! Such pep! Such verve! Such unswerving confidence!
So you'll be able to simply cure the blorbs, then! Correct?
Oh... Uh... Well...
Oh! How absolutely wretched...
Such a thing has never happened in the history of the kingdom!
Soon the entire Mushroom Kingdom will get the blorbs...
We've gotta find the cause and get this place back to normal!
Hrm... If this is even beyond the power of a Star Sprite...
Yeah, obviously, but we've never dealt with something like this!
I have absolutely no idea what to do! I suggest we panic!
Well, I did some research on similar afflictions, but...
The blorbs is in a class of its own. It seems to be incurable...
If we could just find a cause, we'd have a place to start...
Pull yourself together, man! We have to do SOMETHING!
My son... He's also... He's also got the blorbs!
The medical staff did what we could to ease the swelling...
But as far as we can tell, we can't reverse the effects...
Wah...
Princess! We still await...
Yes... We've sent word to the Star Sprites for help, but...
We've gotten no response.
PARDON ME!
Ah, glorious! I daresay our Star Sprite has arrived!
Sorry I'm late! This castle's huge!
So uh... What's up? They're not here yet?
The bros...
Ah! Master Mario! And Master Luigi!
We've awaited your arrival! Let us resume the meeting.
Now then, going on what little information we've unearthed...
The cause MAY be a mushroom sold by a local merchant.
Oh dear! A mushroom?
You mean to tell me that a mushroom causes the blorbs?
Dr. Toadley?
Well, yeah, we interviewed all the blorbed Toads we could...
And they all said they'd bought Blorb Mushrooms.
He's a really famous doctor. He knows EVERYTHING.
He couldn't make it to today's meeting, so his intern is here.
Blorb Mushrooms?
Perplexing... Not a local variety, of that I'm quite sure.
What sort of rapscallion would sell such a thing?
Well, according to one witness, it was a fellow in a cape...
All signs point to the suspect not being from this kingdom.
Well... Whoever he is, he's our only lead.
So it's decided! Let's go find him!
Master Mario! Master Luigi! Your hour is at hand!
Go forth and stomp this fellow as if he were Bowser!
GWAHAHA!
Yes! It was my star power and Peach's wish power!
It weakened you, didn't it?!
Whuh... What...
All right! Peach!
Let's clean up this mess!
You've saved me once again. Thank you.
Well, that's one way to break up a meeting...
Seems like it's pretty much adjourned, by boogity...
Should we cancel it?
Hrm... Young man, we're facing a national emergency.
If we cancel the meeting, nothing will get solved.
Absolutely. The blorbs are more pressing than Bowser.
The meeting must go on!
Mercy! You ARE the princess!
Take heed, gentlemen and star! That's how one does things!
But we surely can't use this ravaged room anymore...
Shall we continue someplace a touch less demolished?
So I'm an outcast, huh?! What'd I do to deserve this?!
You docs gotta do SOMETHING! This is a national emergency!
Thanks for the news flash! Obviously we want to help!
BWAHAHA!
Castle, tower, whatever! I'll pummel anything!
Is that... HEY!
Hey! Minion! Hold up!
Ooh, is that an Attack Piece?!
So Bowser swallowed some of those as well...
Hm? You don't know about them? Attack Pieces are fragments that form Bros. Attacks.
If you collect all 10 of the Attack Pieces, you'll be able to use that Bros. Attack.
What's a Bros. Attack? Well... I'll tell you later.
If there's one Attack Piece here, I'm willing to bet that there are others nearby...
Let's find them!
Trash Pit Attack Pieces You got piece #!
Pieces left to find: 
Trash Pit Attack Pieces You got piece #!
Pieces left to find: 
Whoa! What was that loud noise?
It came from the room next door!
Got it! You guys check it out!
I'll guard the princess!
Flab Zone Attack Pieces You got piece #!
Pieces left to find: 
Nothing but dead ends here... Not an exit to be seen.
Oh...
Well, that was a short debate. We decided it would be prudent just to explore this area.
Except me!
Flab Zone Attack Pieces You got piece #!
All Flab Zone pieces found!
You got a new Bros. Attack!
Flab Zone Attack Pieces You got piece #!
Pieces left to find: 
...I think I may know. Fawful may be looking for the Dark Star...
No one can break the seal on the Dark Star sleeping beneath Toad Town...
So, did you look around? See an exit anywhere?
Well, again we play the waiting game for some bodily change...
...Now he needs the princess? What could that mean?
Dark Star?
Aha! No wonder those guys are trying to find the Dark Star!
...But why would they need you, Princess Peach?
Hey, welcome to my badge store!
Sorry for prying... but do you know how to change badges? 
Nope.
Of course!
OK, I figured. I'll teach you.
Of course you do. Good luck out there!
Come again!
Hey there, welcome to my badge store, guys!
You fellas have a need for some badges or what?
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
It is... But why do you ask?
Lord Junior! Dearest child of Bowser! Our Captain! Our hero!
We're at your service, hey? Just tell us how we can help!
Larry! Lemmy!
I, um, just need to make a quick stop...
Since this is your "tofu," answer me this...
Gah!
I don't know what you have in mind, but it feels like evil scheming. Are you evil scheming?
Have you seen any of the other Koopalings recently?
You know... Larry? Lemmy? Wendy? Roy? Morton?
Seriously? Great timing, guys.
Because, honestly, I'd normally be on board. But this really isn't the time.
Bah! You're no fun.
Oh, it's worse than I thought!
Young Master! We've got to get out of here!
Yeah, and we didn't even have to lift any of our perfectly-toned fingers.
Now! Brute Morton! Dispose of this tiny but surprisingly annoying creature!
What are you waiting for? RUN!
Bye-byeeee!
No! I won't run! I'm gonna help Larry and Lemmy!
Ooh, heehee! We are so naughty.
Huh, it's Mario and Luigi.
And now that we have the Malatone Formula:X, even Lord Fawful...
No! What am I saying? Even LOSER Fawful doesn't stand a chance!
The Koopalings were scattered...the kingdom in disarray.
Blorbed Minions littered the landscape like oversized novelty balloons...and Lord Bowser Jr. was defeated.
These were some of the toughest times the Minions had ever faced.
Yet despite the staggering odds...I never lost faith.
I knew that Lord Junior and Lord Bowser would pull us through...somehow...
One day... One day, for sure.
One day we'll swoop on in and save Lord Junior from trouble.
Just...not today, yeah? For now, we wait.
Yeah...waiting's good.
Sure, right. It's not that you're terrified or anything.
...Oh, you're going to hit me again, aren't you.
Cool, we got the stuff. Now let's hurry up and get back to the castle!
But Dad...
Dad's gonna be so impressed!
You're a talking ball!
Young Master! HURRY!
Yes...assuming he has found his way back...
Ooh! If you only knew how important I am...
And for the record... I AM NOT A BALL!
What happened to Lord Bowser?
Hello! Pardon me!
Um... Young Master...
We lost him. Again.
Hey! Watch where you're flying!
We really, truly don't have time to be making new enemies like this...
He IS Lord Bowser, though.
So I'm sure he'll be fine, no matter what happens.
Let's see what we've got here...
Time! That snapped me out of it. He's right!
You're probably right...
Oh, yes. Encapsulated and everything. Well done!
We don't have time for this. Come on, guys!
We were all fired up to rescue Lord Bowser... but he didn't really need our help.
Yeah! I totally MADE that. Impressive, right?
Oh, I suppose I should let you in on something...
Call it a peace offering.
I'm sure Dad will be happy to know you tried...or whatever.
Kaley! Behold...
Yeah? Spit it out, ball!
Lord Junior? You think so?
Your father... Bowser...
What's making all that noise?
You guys were kinda cool out there. I mean, just a little bit.
He's working very hard. You should be proud.
It's Lord Bowser!
Yeah! I'd know that ominous rumble anywhere!
Yes... I have a fun and scientific idea...
I just...I just do. I have a feeling.
What was that for? Look, Morton's just big-boned. He doesn't have the blorbs!
Larry! Lemmy!
Oh, wait. You put that poison stuff in there! Did you just poison Morton? ANSWER ME!
I'm sorry for being a jerk before. You deserve better.
MMM...SWEET.
Lord Junior?
YUMMY...IN MORTON TUMMY...
All right, all right. It's a fight we have here, not a pickling contest.
From now on...I need you guys around. We're a team, OK? And...we're friends.
URGH!
At any rate, you lot... I'm gonna give you the full meal deal, hey?
So, come on! Join me!
Look at that... His metabolism is racing!
The roll is 30 coins. That's what they call prix fixe, mate.
You got it!
Morton! You're kinda glowing and, uh, on fire...
Roll? Do you mean toll?
Larry and Lemmy rejoined your squad!
I don't like this! Morton is my buddy!
Do you know who I am?
The yellow thing said... that Dad was working hard.
A new quest has been added near Bowser's Castle!
Um... Maybe this isn't an awesome idea...
I see... So that giant robot...
Like, I thought the accent was a bad idea at first, but you're really kind of owning it...
And the salad puns, well... Again, you're surprisingly good at them.
Yeah, it's starting to make sense...
Dad's fighting it. He's fighting that giant robot. Awesome!
But did you realize that that's Bowser Jr.? Like...Bowser's actual son!
Man, this is wild. Bahaha!
...Right. Would have been nice to know that all along.
Lord Bowser!!
I have obtained the most toxic creature in this kingdom. Malodorous Fibbian!
Yes, this simple frog is one million times more toxic than a poison mushroom.
But you know what? Maybe it don't matter who he is.
Maybe it only matters who WE are, yeah?
Hey! Wait a second! Larry! Lemmy!
Where do you think you're going?! It's too dangerous!
You'll be crushed for sure!
Ooh...I'm toxinvigorated. Keep talking toxins...
But that robot is INSANE! Even giant Bowser is gonna need our help.
I understand the sentiment, but just THINK a minute.
Wait a second. Where's Beef?
What are you going to do to help stop that thing?
I mean, Bowser himself might squash you and not even notice!
Oh, he said he was staying back to guard the castle.
Are you calling me short?! How dare you!
And I said, "Yah, sure. Take a load off and relax, big guy."
Because even with only two of us, defeating these wimps will be...
A piece of gluten-free cake.
Hey, weirdo! Don't you know who I am? Nothing is easy with me! NOTHING!
Ow...
I'm glad you asked, mate!
BWAHAHA!
Whoa. Dude. Back off.
Young Master!
I've seen them, I have! The Koopalings!
Wheeee!
Teehee!
Really! Truly! I've seen them with me own eyes!
Oh, that was hilarious. Just when he said it wouldn't be easy...it was SO easy.
Chalk up another win for the Best Fitness Friends!
OK, who did you see? And where are they now?!
And then all of us are gonna save Dad!
It was Larry and Lemmy, wannit?
I saw them two runnin' off in that direction, hey!
You hear that, Dad? Hang in there...
Wait... MARIO AND LUIGI?!
Gotcha. That's great news. Let's go!
All right. We got this. LET'S GO!
Guys! We don't have time for this right now. We've got to get that Star Cure!
Hey... Bro...
Oh no!
Let's just pretend we didn't see Bowser's kid, OK?
Should we, y'know...help them out?
Larry! Lemmy! Are you OK?
HEY!
Help 'em?
Nah, mate. They've got things well in hand, haven't they?
Young Master! Look up! UP!
I'm more than just Bowser's kid, you know!
Ugh! They're too heavy!
And what are you, anyway? A yellow ball with feet?!
Young Master! Watch out!
WHOA, BUDDY!
I've also got a shiny star above my head! Let's not forget about that!
Come ON!
Eh? Where's YOUR star, tiny Bowser?
Young Master!
You'll be the death of me!
Now, let's get you to safety. Quickly!
TINY BOWSER?!
Dad says I'm a growing boy, and...
Wait, why am I explaining myself to you?
Show me...
Lord Junior...
Actually, there's no time for that. Let's proceed straight to...Operation Smoothie!
Uh, OK. Whatever.
This is all very touching, but we have three Koopalings left to rescue.
Wendy may be safe at the castle... but I wouldn't count on it.
I've got Skeletone Formula:D... You've got Malodorious Fibbian...
You two are a lot alike. He's rude and has a terrible temper and personality.
Larry and Lemmy were supposed to be at the castle too...
HEY! What are you doing to my Skeletone? I didn't show Dad yet!
Wait! Do you know where Dad is? Where is he? What's he doing?!
I went into the castle with Wendy, but...
Heh. HEH! HAHA, even. It is already done.
You'll find out soon enough.
For now...YELLO GOODBYE!
Most of the Minions there were under Fawful's control.
He was giving them this bizarre supplement that made them go wild.
We've supplemented the supplement...
I give you...
Hey! Wait!
HEY!
I managed to rescue Lemmy before he was caught, but then we had to escape.
Malatone Formula:X!
And what did it mean about Dad working hard?
HEY!
So, what happened to Wendy?
NO! Why'd you do that? Now how am I supposed to impress Dad?
HEY, HEY, HEY!
I don't know! We lost track of her in the confusion.
Oh, you're still here. How unfortunate for you.
Dieter! I'm thinking we dispose of this problem...now-ish.
You lot are steppin' on our tofu.
OK. Let's go rescue them. I bet they're ALL still there. Even Roy.
Um...Bro?
What makes you think Roy's at the castle?
I think you mean turf. They're on our turf.
Oi! I'm not here to split pears, hey? This lot gets the message right well.
We can't let you into our romaine, yeah?
That...that beast...
Yeah! If they keep walkin' this way, you'll lettuce pound 'em, right?
Good one, brother.
LORD JUNIOR. RUN...NOW...
It's true! That thing...is my dad.
This Malatone is even more powerful than I imagined.
Watch as it invigorates every muscle cell in his body...
And simultaneously shuts down every brain cell!
That's right! All ten of them!
That gigantic monster is Lord Bowser?!
How could that be...
And now he is fit to do our bidding. Super strong, super violent.
A new Best Fitness Friend!
LORD...
JUNIOR...
GWAAAAAH!
Ooh, look at that. It's like a beautiful painting.
Where IS Bowser, anyway? Not so scary when the bloke's never around, is he?
Besides, you know how it is with royalty. The second generation's always soft.
Who says WE can't run the Mushroom Kingdom, innit?
And we're done here.
Go ahead, Morton. Destroy them!
So, are we...actually... gonna fight him?
Him being...Lord Bowser's son?
GWAAAAAH!
It's not just for giggles, yeah? Them 30 coins ain't nothin' to sneeze at.
Why d'ya think we're wearing these glasses? 'Cause our future's so bright!
Morton! Stop that this instant!
All I see is trouble...
He's not attacking! I guess we'll need to work this out ourselves.
No more backtalk, mate.
It's avocado time!
Guys, do you at least have a plan?
Hey.
Nope!
Hold on... Isn't Toad Town around here somewhere?
Hey, hey, hey!
But I won't just sit here when Lord Bowser needs me.

It's part of that Squid Fit fad. You're buff, you don't need it.
Nobody leaves town because some big monster's around...

Good and evil are outdated, simplistic terms!
Everything is relative!
Is it wrong for me to help my dad try to take over the Mushroom Kingdom?
Look at this flimsy thing! Time for some burnage!
Wait, what happened? HEY! Why did no flames come out?!
Hey! You in my belly! Wake up! You hear me?!
 What's wrong?!
I'll tell you what's wrong! My flames aren't working!
You probably messed something up in there!
I didn't touch anything! Don't blame me for this!
Hey, jerky, I never had any trouble until you got in there!
I was a burning MACHINE! And now you broke me!
SO FIRE ME BACK UP!
Now, just hang on a sec!
What would I have to gain by disabling your flame system?
Do I look like I need logic? Listen, I NEED to breathe fire!
I'm sure you do! And I'm also sure I didn't disable it!
So have a good time trying to fight without your fire and all.
YELLO GOOD-BYE!
Hey! HEY!
GRAAAARGH!
This is complete garbage! I've gotta get my fire back!
Someday I'll get that punk!

Why did you take that shape?
Affirmative. Correct. I have taken on the form likely to aid communication with you.
It is based on the host's most carefully preserved memory.
Yeah, so, uh... We really need to know the combination to Bowser's safe...
Affirmative. The...safe?
Affirmative. Correct. The safe combination.
Danger-avoidance protocols have unilateral failure.
Affirmative. Correct.
Failure? What's THAT mean?
Are you saying that the combination isn't here?
Negative. Incorrect.
The combination is here.
Affirmative. Correct. This is the combination.
Hm? The others?
I don't know...
I didn't even really understand I'd been inhaled until I realized I might be inside Bowser.
I bet everyone else is in here somewhere, but...
Right now I have no clue where anyone is...
Yeah, definitely inside Bowser...
Who knows how in the world THAT happened, but one thing's for sure...
If we don't find the others soon, we're all in BIG trouble!
Yeah, you're right.
We'd better just press on. Someone might be nearby!
HEY! LEMME GO!
NOW! RELEASE ME!
NOT how to treat a lady!
YAH! QUIT IT! That...tickles!
QUIT IT!
NOW!
Mario! You saved me!
Watch out! Here it comes!
Thank you so much for saving me, Mario.
GLOBIN!
I am a wandering Emoglobin. I come bearing knowledge.
O strange pipe-ish thing I see! How I long to slide  down upon you to sink down below!
For then might I fly skyward! Or perhaps travel to far places. There are many pipe-ish types.
O traveler, when you find a pipe-ish thing, please slide  down! Remember, or be forever globin!
See you globin!
RRRGH!
Hmm...
I'm pretty sure we're inside Bowser's body.
After Bowser inhaled me, I woke up and wandered around...
And then that amoeba thing grabbed me out of the blue.

You got Block Fangs!
You got a Block Ring!
The last Blitty! Ah, it arrives!
Success! Ah oui! My petit Broggy!
You can take a walk at long last!
Hmm... This passage is blocked!
I know that voice, by boogity...
Is Mario in here?
Wow, it IS Mario!
It's me, Toadbert!
Yeah, Bowser inhaled me too. With almost the whole castle.
I'm so happy we met up! Well, I'm not happy we're here, but...
Did you get attacked by those white soldier things too?
Oh yeah, I sure did...
I guess it's just their job. They attack anything foreign that gets into Bowser's body.
...Anyway, gotta say, it's pretty interesting in here, by boogity!
There's all kinds of weird stuff! I feel like a gut spelunker!
Hmm? Princess Peach?
Oh yeah, it makes sense that she would've been inhaled too...
Unfortunately, I haven't seen her around here anywhere...
She's gotta be in his body somewhere, though...
I guess you just gotta keep trudging around, huh?
First we need a way out...
Hm! It looks like that had some sort of effect on Bowser's arm.
His arm?
Yeah, I've been poking around... This whole area is a pressure point for Bowser's arm...
It's just a theory, but I think if he punches while moving, he'll punch much harder than before!
Hey, up there! It looks like your punch power increased! Try punching while moving!
Yeah, try it! If it works, you'll be able to break stuff you couldn't before, right?
Uh, well, I'm not sure I can accept...
Well, looks like you guys have this under control. I'm gonna go scout some other areas.
If I find anything, I'll holler. See you later, by boogity!
So is this Toad Town?!
If we go that way, we'll be KO'd in no time.
Let's find another route.
Bwahahahahahahaha! Got a little carried away!
Security system, huh...
If we try to go through there, we'll get toasted like Bowser.
We'd better go see if we can find a different route!
Look upon this Emoglobin, for it is one with save-ish abilities.
Is that not globin?
But...
I am a rare-ish, not-often-ish, save-ish Emoglobin...
Do I not globin?
O traveler, save your globin? 
Don't save.
Yes, save!
..................
We beseech you to save the life of our host...
We ask that you help the host Bowser recover...
We are Evoglobins...
The evolution of Emoglobins... Transcendent spiritual forms...
We are Evoglobins...
Waves of spirituality spawned us temporary arms and legs...
We carry with us a message of crisis for Bowser's life energy.
We have awaited you in this sacred place, ever patient...
First you must hit the Emoglobin to the right to save...
Then it falls to you to revive Bowser's flagging life energy...
Board the boats of revival and ford the adrenaline channel.
Board the boats of revival? 
Save first.
Board.
Ford the channel again? 
Maybe later.
Let's go!

Ah, the room where I keep my sweetest stolen treasures...
This is one place that stupid Fawful NEVER could break into!
Yes, a victory feast!
Please, we insist that you eat all you like!
Heehee!
Bon appétit!
Hmmmmm? Done eating?
But we went to great lengths to make King Bowser the most high-calorie, high-fat dishes!
You love this stuff. So please! Eat more.
Hush now, don't say that.
Here! How about we just feed it to you!
Please! We insist! This way!
Whoa!
Nice spread!
BWAHAHAR!
So many greasy, succulent, very unhealthy dishes! I've been craving this stuff like crazy!
I'm gonna eat it all!
Uuuuurp... Oh, man... Getting kinda full...
Nah, I'm sick of eating!
Ooof! Hrrrgh?
OWWWW!
What? What is it?! What's wrong?
What is this stuff? These look like crops!
Who the heck FARMS in this kingdom?
Ouch! Owwwww! What the--YOWCH!
Careful! Don't you know?
Wiggler Family Farm has raised vegetables for generations.
What is it, do you think? You ate too much carrot?
Hey. Bug. Do I look like I care about vegetables?
So listen up. You seen a Banzai Bill around here?
GRROWCH!
Banzai Bill? Not here.
Listen! Ch-Chippy! Do something!
I can't take this! Now! Make it better!
Violence isn't farm fresh, no. Here we just have fine organic vegetables free from pesticides.
Peach has a standing order. You should try them. Free-range carrots are absolutely divine.
Full of vitamins and minerals. Wonderful for a lustrous mane. Aids beauty and dietary health.
Also good for burning fat, healing joints, firming nostrils, supplying nutrition to muscles...
But the kingdom's in danger!
If we delay, we may never get your castle back!
SHUT UP!
Quick... Now... Gut... Pain...
Vegetables are GROSS! Don't you have any meat?!
Meat. Oh, absolutely not. A healthy body craves no meat.
And those who make fun of vegetables will one day pay.
Press  while moving.
My belly starts feeling better, and now my ARM hurts?! C'mon!
Hey! You in there! What are you doing to my bod?!
What's that? Punch while moving?
You don't say. Guess I'll try it! I'm feeling better now anyway. A solid punching will feel good!
GAH HA HA!
Oh baby, you're GOOD!
Chippy! You get it done! That's it, you're my new minion! You can thank me later!
Hey, don't be shy, now! I know you're fired up! Go ahead, bask in it!
...All right! Time to use that Banzai Bill!
Back to the cannon!
MY BELLY HURTS!
What? Well, if it isn't you. Still here, are you?
Straaaange. You seem somehow more powerful.
Strong enough to rid the farm of those rocks, perhaps?
An entry was added to the Guide.
The rocks are covering some fine soil, but I can't move them. No, I'm far too small...
Stupid boulders... I oughta punch 'em...
I guess we have to deal with this. Bowser, don't move, OK?
I'll go find out what's causing all this pain!
Ow! OWWW! Chippy! I'm going nuts up here!
What are you doing?! Do something now!
GRAAAAAA AAAAAAGH!
Having yourself some kind of hoedown in my body! MY BODY!
I've never been so disgusted! No WAY do I stand for this!
So THIS time, I'm taking your precious princess!
GOOWCH!
Hurts...
Really hurts!
NGGWAAARF!
CHARGE!
Yeah. Pretty tough dude, all around.
Oh yeah! I forgot!
Now I can kidnap her!
What. What in the...
WHAT IS THIS?!
WHY DID GREEN 'STACHE AND MARIO COME OUT OF MY GUT?!
Wait... YOU!
That voice...
CHIPPY?!
You're telling me YOU'RE Chippy?!
There...
FWAHAHAHA! Awake at last!
The dark power is complete!
WAIT!
CRUD!
Yup. Sure did.
Fake me ate Fawful.
That whole bad feeling of yours came true.
Hmph. What do I care about some stupid wannabe me?
I just want Princess Peach. And maybe the dark power.
What's wrong?
You're kidding me! Dark Bowser got Fawful?
That means...that the dark power is now complete!
All of your abilities, along with the fully awakened dark power... Dark Bowser...
...This is the absolute worst- case scenario!

I'm sick of icky blocks!
No way!
The red one is all mine!
NUH-UH!
What's this craziness?! That guy's not a Sockop?!
Whatever. It worked out!
Now we can chug both those guys at once!
Whoa... What... That was weird.
Mine!
No! Mine!
I found it first! Not you! Me!
So I get to chug it!
You crawled into a KO'd Sockop and hopped around.
That's just sick!
You travel to Toad Town? That is quite a walk...
Would it not be easier to fly to Toad Town?
You can do that?
The power of outer space... I mean, the earth, is mighty.
A short time ago I launched a large, angry being.
Do you dare? Will you try it? 
No thanks. 
Launch us!
Very well. Your journey begins by gazing into outer space.
Do not watch me. It is no fun if you know my secret.
Here I go.
You go!
What? You wish to go to Toad Town?
Shall I launch you? 
No thanks. 
Launch me!
The mists of consciousness part, and two figures emerge. Why?
Here, in this place, Chakron meditates on the nature of all. It is Chakron's special place.
And outsiders who disturb the mental peace are not welcome.
We didn't mean to disturb you. We heard you have a Star Cure, and we really need it!
You are a very strange being. Popping out of nowhere. Odd.
If we don't get all three Star Cures, the kingdom is doomed!
There's just one left! We need to find it at any cost!
The universe frowns upon such begging. It scoffs at your wish.
Besides, allow me to enlighten you to something: I am busy.
I am afraid you must go.
What am I busy with? Can you not tell?
Truly? Look up.
You look at the sky and this pose and still do not know?
You are unenlightened. That is why you are in a cosmic pickle.
This pose absorbs waves from the deep parts of outer space.
The waves crash upon my mind's shore. I am a mental beach.
With the power of outer space upon me, I can do anything.
Of late, large waves have rolled in, and wisdom surfs upon them.
My brain hangs ten.
And how long have I surfed? A thousand years. A thousand.
A thousand years?! Why don't you take a break already?!
Everyone needs breaks!
In truth...I would enjoy that. Meditation does grow tiresome.
But breaking out of my state of perfect balance will be hard.
A thousand-year balance... My body rhythm is like stone.
If you somehow found a way to break such an impenetrable rhythm, the Star Cure...is yours.
Well. Then here shall I remain, immobile.
This new pose displeases me...
And gluing all those posts back together will be very tiresome.
And now a thousand-year pose has fallen into the past's void.
Outer space waves will crash now on an empty mental shore...
I requested my balance upset, but did not believe. How sad.
But I am already over my saddened state. I am at peace.
Hey! Hand it over!
No, I do not feel like it now. Leave me at one with the sky.
ARE YOU CRAZY?! YOU'RE A SAGE!
You have to keep your promise to us!
Yes... I promised. Wait...a moment.
I lack...energy...
I offer this!
You got the third Star Cure!
Oh. This new pose pleases me greatly.
Waves of energy flow up from the earth to me.
I shall now assume this pose for a hundred years.
Well. If you would leave me to my meditations...
OK! We have all three of the Star Cures!
Let's race to Dr. Toadley's in Toad Town!
Thanks, Mr. Chakron!
No. Do not be childish. Tickling and poking do nothing.
This balance can only be upset by some sort of POW! Some sort of drastic event.
Nothing! I feel nothing!
You are truly unenlightened to believe in such antics.
Wow! He's a rock! Mario! Luigi!
He wants a POW! Do your best attack and take him down!
Nothing! I feel nothing!
Not even close. Not a wiggle. Not a single astral shimmy.
Unless you have an attack that shakes the ground, give it up.
A ground-shaking attack...
Where would we find an attack like that, I wonder...
The wood.
Oh. I said that out loud, did I? I suppose that is OK.
The attack is in the wood.
How do you know?
There is nothing that outer space knows not.
You hear a lot if you listen for a thousand years.
Time for you to perambulate. The wood. Yes. The wood.
Have your minds opened to a ground-shaking attack?
Shall you try it out? 
Don't try it.
Try it.

 Anger benefits you not...
This door is pure technology. It is also retro-vintage chic.
If you want to open the door... hit the left pillar's switch.
If your hand can't reach it, slam it with something else.
This door is a technological miracle. It will not break.
 Touch the Chakroad again...
Our journey took us to a place etched in your mind.
Do you understand? No. For you are unenlightened.
What?
I forgot something important.
Right now, Bowser is moving with , right?
Well, if you press  or , Mario and co. will move again.
If you want to move Bowser, press  again.
Whoever's screen is lit up is who you're currently moving.
When Mario and co. want to move, use  or .
Did you get that? Because it's super important!
Use  and  to move Mario and Luigi, and  to move Bowser.
Hey! I was JUST HERE!
Wondrous. Thrilling. Yes. Powers of earth and space.

Umm... Iggy's been gone for, like, a day.
You have a point. I wonder how long this Kuzzle fellow thinks it has been...
Poor Charlie mostly forgot how to speak. I've been teachin' him.
I made sure he knew how to talk "hip." Like all the young hepcats talk.
I was feelin' quite lonely here, what with bein' all alone.
I'm glad my grandson came on home. I can't imagine life without him now.
Wow... Whoa! What was that all about?!
Well, I was just trying to do something to revive your body and...
Whatever I did made your body get huge.
Really?! Well, it was awesome! Do it again, and I'll be able to crush Fawful like a bug!
Unfortunately, it doesn't look like I can. Apparently it only works in dire situations...
Really. Well... Weak.
Whatever. Even at this size, I can still take anyone!
We'll be at my castle soon! And then it's payback time!

Oh, Lizzy! My sweet granddaughter! I'm so happy to see you again!

Or are you Britt? Stacy? No, Danielle! Anna?  No, Corrine...  Darcy?
Uh, how many grandchildren do you have?!
Sounds like they're looking for Ludwig.
I don't trust 'em, but it's a lead...
Translation: I'd rather stay with you, grandfather. I cherish my life here.
Didja see? My sweet Bernadette went off to Dimble Wood.
I advise these gentlemen to kindly take their leave of us.
Bernadette?
That's a totally different name than Lizzy!
Huh? Oh, maybe it wasn't Bernadette...
Was it Scarlet? Harriet... Juliet... Juliette?

Sure! Oh, a little bit never hurt no one. It's a standard cure fer amnesia, really.
So we just...shock him? Then what?
Let's try fighting him instead! He'll remember that!
I'm not sure about any of this...
Yeah... It's weirding me out.
Hey, gramps! Listen up!
Huh? Who's Charlie?
Hmm...
I don't much like the idea of my boy never rememberin' his buds.
We need to get his rememberins back so he can decide what'll make him happiest.
Our time together ended too soon, but I'll always treasure it.
Please remember to come visit your grandpappy every now and again.
Those're some good buddies you got. You take good care of 'em.
That right? Friends, you say? True buds, as it were?
Lessee here... How about we try a bit o' shock therapy?
You think they're my buddies?
Well, my brain is still a bit addled, so I'll go with it.
Catch ya on the flipside, daddio! Bahaha!
My grandson... My Charlie boy... I blinked and he grew up on me.
He's...not fully cured, is he...
Iggy rejoined your squad!
Well then. Young Master! Next, we should...
Hey! It's them!
Beef!
Are you SURE Ludwig is here?
Stop talking like that! You should be saying "Bahaha"!
C'mon, Iggy. Snap out of it!
Ludwig?
Kamek! Use your magic and cure his amnesia!
Huh? Isn't that...
Lizzy? That's my Lizzy girl!
Wheeee!
No way, gramps! This beach is aces.
It's been a real fizz- pop summer, ain't it?
These wet rags can go chase themselves!
What? Oh, yes, Charlie.
Time really does fly.
Pauline?
What's going on here? You two just met!
Julietta?
Well, that confirms it. Poor Iggy has amnesia.
What's that, now?
How do you tots know my Charlie boy?
Iggy is our—
He's our friend!
What? No. Stop right there.
Your eyes say it all. I catch what yer throwin'.
Charlie, my boy! What say you?
Do you wanna go back to your buddies?
Come on, Iggy! Time to remember!
Ugh... What's going on?
What happened?
Iggy! Are you yourself again?
I don't know... Am I?
Bahaha!
HOORAY! Iggy's really back! He's got his crazy laugh again!
Oh. It's you guys!
What are we doing here? Let's go get that onion thing!
DOUBLE HOORAY!
His memories are back too!
Psst. Young Master...
I can't believe that worked.
This old man...
He seems...slightly confused.
What were you saying about my memories? I lost them?
Bahaha! That's great!
Well, Charlie...I knew this day'd come. I wish you the best of luck, my boy.
Listen, we... We wanna rejoin as minions...
Sir, it was an extreme error of judgment to trust Fawful.
We offer our unflinching allegiance back to you!
Wait, Private Goomp! Sergeant Guy! And Corporal Paraplonk!
You mutineers are still here?! Get out of here this instant!
Waah!
And you minions, too! Go fix my castle!
Us minions... You mean... We're back in?
Yes, just get to it!
Next time, you'd better pull your weight beating Mario!
Thank you SOOO MUUUCH!
I thought you might attack Peach's Castle again, so...
I came to check on you.
Hmph!
Hey, my castle got trashed too, y'know. That's my next project.
Remodeling's not evil!
TEE HEE HEE HEE HEE!
That's a great attitude!
Shut up! Go away!
Yes, yes, I'm going.
Enjoy your present from Princess Peach!
No! I don't want it!
Your Ungratefulness... You won't open it?
Quiet, you! Go get back to work! Do something useful!
Sheesh... Take it easy...
So, uh, King Bowser! How are you feeling?
FYI! FYI! FYI! FYI! FYI!
Message from Princess Peach!
Who disturbs me?!
Hey! Chase that stupid bird out of here NOW!
Your Rottenness, it's from Peach's Castle!
Peach's Castle?!
From Peach, apparently...
Package! Package!
Package from Princess Peach to Large Angry Bowser Guy!
HELLO YELLO!
What in the... YOU! What do YOU want?!
OK, so next to that is an item store.
Good for mushrooms, syrup jars, you know.
That's Dr. Toadley's clinic. When folks are hurting or sick, they head there.
The Mushroom Kingdom is nuts for diets and fitness now.
Have you seen all the weird fads popping up everywhere?
The clinic's right up there... but I can't reach it. Oog...
Toadley Clinic
Mom and Dad are always shopping! BOOOORING!
Hey! Wanna play hide-and-seek? 
Next time.
Play!
DR. TOADLEEEY! 
Killer! Think you can find me, huh, Mario?
I'll be somewhere in the mall...or inside its shops!
Oh, yeah! Don't go outside or you'll have to start over.
OK... Here I go!
Oh! Mario! You hear the huge news?!
The blorbs are cured! They cured it!
Whoa! You found me! Mario, you're amazing!
OK, I'm hiding again! So... Here I goooo!
You heard, right? Dr. Toadley RULES!
And Toad Town is peaceful again!
Now the mall will be JUMPING!
Wow! I thought you'd never check the same place twice!
That was a super-fun game! Thanks a bunch, mister!
Here, I have a prize for you! It's my favorite!
If you haven't yet checked out every shop, you oughta!
Get on that!
Let's play again sometime!
So the blorbs are all taken care of. That's a relief!
Now all we have left to do is take Peach back...
Let's use the Miracle Cure to destroy the castle blockade!
You got a Mushroom Ball!
East and south from there is a small store...
It's awesome. They sell badges in there.
But the owner's stubborn...
Word is she only stocks stuff that she likes.
HEY! Fine, I'm out! I'm outside, sheesh!
Badges are not toys! They're very serious!
Go play hide-and-seek or something!
I swear, that husband of mine... He's all about bonus cards!
He always claims he'll win back all the coins he spends!
So he buys stuff we don't need. Worst financial planner ever.
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
You got a Small Shell!
I'm gonna roll down the stairs! HAAAAAAALP!
Where am I? I rolled down here and got discombobulated.
Oh, well, hey there, Mario. They cured the blorbs, huh?
What, me? This is what I normally look like.
Huh? Hey, look at this pipe... It's like the one in Bowser!
How lucky! We can move on!
Seems as though Bowser is headed for Dimble Wood...
He has no idea the sage with the Star Cure is inside him.
Well, let's go in!
My daaaaarling!
I did it! A front-row seat! Lining up early totally paid off, even if I did survive on lint!
I mean, Lord Fawful is just way too popular! If you wanna see a show, you've gotta WORK at it!
Can't wait for... Lord Fawful!
So I charged in and wiped out... Long story short, NO SEAT.
I waited ten days in line, man... Ten days in line...
Yessss? What is it?
It!
Yes, take an open seat, pleeeease.
Pleeease!
Oh, dear guest, I feel for you, but there's naught I can dooo.
Ooooo!
Is there a problem?
Oh, Boss, phew! This guy...
So this big galoot here, right? He's all like, I have no seeeat! No seeeat! And he won't shut up!
But he won't stop, and we're all, we just can't do it, buddy, OK? So we have no idea what to do.
And this lug's getting surlier. He's not going away. And he has no seat! Nothing! Not a chance!
So we do some solid thinking and totally fail. No big seats! I mean, we got small seats!
We can do a small seat, sure, but this guy's huge, so he's not gonna fit in a small one! Please!
And it's kinda bugging me, 'cause I'm on my feet all day! I mean, I'd LOVE to sit in ANY seat!
It's like, hey, pal, how about you try our job just once, y'know? It'd break him in two seconds!
I work hard, Boss! Really hard! And this dude sits through life?! So spoiled! It makes me ill!
All the suffering in the world, and this guy's seating problem is urgent? Nooooooo!
There are NO seats left?!
Man, not a seat in the house!
Where do I lodge a complaint?!
HEY!
I have no seat!
The show starts soooooon! Please take your seats!
There are NO open seats! Do something now!
Lord Fawful's show always packs 'em in, bro! It's like a full-on full house in here!
What? Old gnarly dude needs a seat? You didn't get one? Soooooo MEGA LAME!
Both of you, zip it! I AM KING BOWSER!
I'm not a guest! I AM KING BOWSER!
Oh yeah? Really? The VIP treatment?
............
Seats!
Uh... Right. Gotcha.
At long last, honey. Lord Fawful's show is upon us, sweet honey.
Whoa.
Truth! Spectating with my honey is like eating honey, honey!
Um... So the issue here is this guest lacks a seat?
Sweet honeeeeeey!
Bowser? Aha! King Bowser! Of course! How stupid of me! I was just handed your name!
Lord Fawful has arranged for special VIP treatment for you! Only the finest, of course!
So, my dear King Bowser! Allow me to prepare your seat! Just one moment!
Prepare VIP SEEEEEEAT!
And now, without further ado, THE FAWFUL SHOOOOOOOW!
What was this castle named? Looking at your face, I feel like I almost remember...
Uhhhh... Schnauzer, chowser, trouser, showser, louser... Ah, who even cares?
Bingo! Just perfect!
That seat is pure Bowser!
Hey, down in front, buddy! You're too tall! Move it! I can't see Lord Fawful!
At long last is right, darling! But time stands still as I watch shows with my darling, darling!
I'm not crying...you're crying...
I'm not crying!
MORTON NOT CRY.
Um...
...Awkward...
All right, guys! I'm fired up now!
Let's find those fitness jerks and kick them right in their toned butts!
Get outta here! You're a disgrace to the Minions!
Yeah! I'm always in for a butt-kicking!
Oh...uh...I guess we should go...
They don't stand a chance against us!
Um, Private Goomp...
Let's show 'em what the Koopa Troop can do!
Bored. Bored. Bored. I'M BORED!
Yes. And then afterward, let's throw them into the lava.
Wheee! Haha!
Hey!  You guys!
As for you, minions...
Let's fight or something!
Larry!
Roy!
Wendy!
Lemmy!
Forward march!
Ah...Lord Junior... We'd love to, of course... But we can't right now!
You guys...
You guys take the lead!
Sir, yes, sir!
What? Why not?!
Wait a second... You're the guys who were working with that Fawful creep, aren't you?
I'm...sorry.
Um...well... You see...
I've got this weird... burning...in my gut.
And I don't think it's just that spicy drumstick.
Nah, it's OK. I get it. You were messed up by that Malatone stuff.
Anyway, let's fight!
Oh, Morton...
You big lug!
I'm not...
Gahaha! That's 342 wins for me! Bowser rules!
Yeah, but you've got 341 losses! Best out of 800 wins it!
Morton!
Iggy!
Ludwig!
You guys back them up!
Look sharp, everyone! It's time to shine!
Oh, hey dude. I finally ate that drumstick.
It was gross. Learn to cook!
GRRRRR...
GARRGGHHHH!
Oh, you wanna fight for it?
UGH...
MMM...*CHOMP* *CHOMP*
Are those footsteps?
Yep. Watch out...I don't know quite what we're dealing with.
I still can't believe Fawful turned out to be such a coward...
I guess we lucked out...
Since we were with Lord Junior the whole time, we never fell under his control.
I guess you guys at the castle had a pretty rough time, huh!
I guess we lucked out...
Since we were with Lord Junior the whole time, we never fell under his control.
I guess you guys at the castle had a pretty rough time, huh!
Wheeee!
I just don't understand how any self-respecting minion could ever fight against Lord Bowser!
Oh.
I think it's guilt.
It's funny you say that...
You guys have all just been trying to help me...
That's a bold move, walking down the middle of the road like that!
I heard that you tricked Lord Bowser and actually locked him inside his own vault!
So yeah...while he may have forgiven you...WE HAVEN'T.
You're gonna have to earn back our trust.
Aye, aye!
All this time I just wanted to show off for Dad...
But I never realized what it is that makes him so strong.
It's you guys.
Aye, aye!
Now you're talkin'!
Eh? Maybe you can't hear me on account of eating that poison.
Ha! Maybe you are growin' up.
Anyway, you owe me another spicy drumstick. Don't think I won't collect!
*sniffle*
He gets it!
I'm NOT, OK...
Thanks, guys. I'm gonna be a better Bowser Jr.
Nah, it's OK. I get it. You were messed up by that Malatone stuff.
Anyway, let's fight!
We're with you.
Um... We'd rather not.
MORTON FEEL FEELINGS TOO.
I don't care what you'd rather! Just hurry up and get ready!
I didn't fully realize it until just now.
You guys came back to help me, even when I was being ridiculous.
Two weeks later...
All right guys, I need you psyched up for one more battle...
We're really gonna take it to Dad this time, OK?
Hope you're ready, Dad!
...MORTON SLEEP?
Aw, buddy... You're back! *sniffle*
MASTER...EYES LEAK?
STOP LEAK, MASTER!
What are they?
What? What's wrong?
What's with you?!
Those are aliens that once invaded the Mushroom Kingdom?
You defeated them when you were babies?!
Why are they here?
Bowser must have grabbed some of the survivors and cryogenically frozen them...
As always, his hobbies are pretty much pure evil.
Whew... That was pretty scary... Alien invasions are no fun!
What I can't believe is that you defeated those things as a baby! Only you could do that, Mario!
Hm? Luigi fought hard as well?
Heehee! Did you attack them with some ferocious crying?
Really? Luigi was the one to defeat them at the end?
Really?
You got 10 Bowser's Castle Attack Pieces at once!
All Bowser's Castle pieces found!
You got a new Bros. Attack!
Oh... Wow.
I'm sorry, Luigi. You really are super.
Yes, you're both super.
Now let's quit dawdling and get back to work!
Brilliant!
Sounds like that guy's Star Cure is already in my castle!
WHAT?!
You gotta be kidding me! They got to it first?!
That's IT! I've GOTTA get that second Star Cure!
I'm making for Bowser's Castle!
The cure's in the underground treasure chamber, right?
Kuh-King Bowser! You're OK!
Yeah...
When you got all giant back in Dimble Wood, we kinda panicked and ran to avoid being crushed.
So while we were, uh, retreating, we must've gotten separated in the forest somehow...
Now it's just me...
Sir, what brings you to this area?
Oh, hey, wait! Those Star Cures, do they look anything...
Like this?
Sir!
I can report that there is a Star Cure in Bowser's Castle!
FYI! FYI! FYI!
Message for Mr. Mario, Mr. Luigi, and Mr. Violent Face-Puncher!
Now connecting to Dr. Toadley in Toad Town!
Please give your attention!
Ah... Check one! Hello? ...Aha! Are we connected?
...Ahem.
Have I just discovered the identity of the second sage? I certainly have.
The second sage is a sea Koopa named Kuzzle who lives on Plack Beach.
And did I see that Mario and Luigi got the first Star Cure already? Indeed I did.
Congratulations!
HEY!
Aren't you Private Goomp?
Of course!
Where are the others?
What happened to Sergeant Guy and Corporal Paraplonk?
Aren't they your unit?
Oh really...
Uh... Well...
...And so I'm on my way to collect all the Star Cures.
Great! I'm gone! To Bowser's Castle!
What's your plan?
Fine! Whatever!
I heard some guy named Kuzzle on Plack Beach gave it to you for doing a puzzle?
I thought that was probably garbage and that you'd just stolen it since you're awesome.
But either way, it's definitely in the underground treasure chamber of Bowser's Castle.
Yes, sir!
I... Uh...
Once I find Sergeant Guy and Corporal Paraplonk, we'll head straight for your castle...
The second Star Cure is at Bowser's Castle, huh...
Guess we should leave this one to Bowser for now...
↑Toad Town →Bumpsy Plains
I dunno... I've never seen one. Probably, though.
Why do you know about it?
...Really?
Hmm... Now that you mention it... Yeah... Maybe that DID happen...
GAHAHA!
What's this, wind? That's your big dark power? A windstorm?!
Talk about wimpy!
Hrrrgh...
Wait, what?
Am I nuts? Did I just hear Mario and Green 'Stache?
What was that?!
What!? I can barely hear with this wind!
Hey! Chippy! C'mon! Who else is in there?!
Chippy?! That you?!
Everything's going nuts out here!
I wish you could see this scene!
Not a good time, Chippy!
No!
The Dark Star... Its power has begun to awaken...
We have to get past this blockade...
Good idea... Let's head to Toad Town and come up with a strategy.
Again the tears are flowing! But not on the face of Fawful!
Fawful is on the cozy couch, sipping tea that laughs at you!
And he is watching the seal on the Dark Star as it breaks...
When it does, all the kingdom will be dark as darkness!
But until then...maybe Fawful will have some shopping.
I HAVE CHORTLES!
Now! The Miracle Cure!
Not bad, huh...
Let's go!
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
So Fawful will fight to help Midbus have victory!
But Midbus has pride...
You figure out who's tougher yet, Mr. Ice Cube?
MIDBUS! POWER UP!
Nuisance barge?
GWAHAHA!
Buddy, you're like a nuisance SUPERTANKER!
Tell you what! Hand over the princess and that Dark Star, and we'll call it good!
Aw, man, AGAIN?! You don't give up!
Well, have it your way! You'll be a nice tune-up for my stomping Fawful!
HOLD UP!
Kidnapping Peach! That is so completely MY move!
One Bowser is plenty, baby! That guy's gotta GO!
Duh... Dark Star...
Ate the Dark Star... Tasted real funky...
YOWWW!
Chest...burning!
Haaaaah... That was gross, but my chest feels better...
It looked like you just swallowed something...
What was that--heartburn?
I mean, with the Dark Star in there somewhere...
    
 REALLY?!
Bah! My chest is getting hot again!
So very darkness!
The dark power builds like a skyscraper of evil!
With the dark power in me, the world... The world...
Your body, I have copied... Your power, I have copied...
Not enough...
Not enough...power...
Not enough dark power...
Power has been drained...
I...have...
I am not complete...
DARKNESS!
Who... Who will give... the dark power...
Her...
No...
That voice...
Yes... I know that voice...
That is the being who drained me of my power...
I HAVE SUCTION!
GWAHAHA!
The world?!
Good one, crazy guy! The world is mine!
Hm?
Got some nasty taste going on in my mouth...
Muh muh muh... Muh muh... Muh...
Here your long journey ends!
WHAT IS THAT?!
Though I fall here... None beat Lord Fawful...
Now who's THIS jerk?!
You're biting my style?! Not on MY watch, buddy!
Now he will FINISH YOU!
I HAVE POWER!
What? Not enough?
Where is the Dark Star?!
Fawful has more suction for the rest of the dark power!
Drained?
Knock it off!
GAHAHAHA! Feels good, finally punching out that weirdo.
And now, I'll just help myself to the Dark Star and the world!
Princess Peach is MINE, pal!
Lord Fawful!
GURK! GWAAK!
Lord Fawful. Leave him to me.
Hnnnnk...
Now you face hot wrath. The hot wrath of my freezing blizzard attack!
IS FOR FAWFUL!
So Fawful leaves him to you!
Such excitement, like a pie made of wow!
The Dark Star's dark power is building!
Lord Fawful... With this, the world...
...Will be ours!
I HAVE ANGST!
Someone attempts to breach the castle.
Do not tell Fawful that. That gives Fawful stress!
We are just at the starting. The power of the Dark Star is still sleepy like a dull baby.
It is taking time for the Dark Star to draw out the power of Princess Peach!
Bad noise!
I have many chortles at such stupidity!
We are snug as bugs snuggling in a comfy rug. The Dark Star's blockade laughs at intruders!
It it it it it it it...
IT WAKES!
It has awakeness at last! Fawful has waited so long!
With this, I am taking the Dark Star's power!
I HAVE CHORTLES!
AND I HAVE EXCITEMENT!
At last, the Dark Star awakes like a naughty napping baby!
Fawful hates your timing!
A nuisance barge barging in at the critical time for us!
I have uneasiness...
Bowser keeps appearing like an ugly rabbit from the hat of a magician who stinks!
I heard that the blorbs were cured!
And thanks to you?! Thanks! To you!
The blorbs have spread throughout all of our dear Toad Town...
Everyone's freaked out. Everyone's trying crazy diets and home remedies...
But nobody knows what will cure it...
Mario! It's all on you! You've gotta save us! Like you always do!
Your Grouchiness!
This is a pretty dense forest. You oughta be able to use  to burn trees with your fire.
Careful, though. If you breathe flames for too long, you'll get all tuckered out.
And of the seven Koopalings, we only have these two...
Right. I'm clearly needed here to watch over the young Master.
Lord Bowser... Please stay safe...
Not too shabby!
Brain guy! Take me to Bowser Castle, and make it snappy!
Oh, right. I knew that.
The bulb is rooooound! ♪ It must be fooooound! ♪
*SIGH*
The Omega-onion... Ugh. Why couldn't the recipe call for a regular onion?!
Are you jabbering again, Kamek? I hate it when you jabber.
Sorry, young Master! I'll try to get a handle on that.
In any case...about that rare bulb...
Morton! Kamek's talking nonsense again. Quick, what's a bulb?
BULB IS...ROUND.
Oh my.
Here I am worrying about Lord Bowser and the castle...
when I should be most concerned about the young Master right now.
BWAHAHA!
BAHAHA!
Down below, a sudden mutation gives the waiting world the...
LIFTOGLOBIN!
O Liftoglobin that lacks the globin to speak like us...
Shh! Do not speak! But move when frozen with chilly globin!
Freeze the very air and climb upon him, or cry forever!
Perfect globin!
Now, when mounted, lead your frozen Liftoglobin steed around with the stylus!
Where do I go, asks Liftoglobin with a glint in his globin... Show him with the stylus!
He follows your globin!
Oh, you want your Liftoglobin to halt? Is that your globin? Then give him a light touch!
A warning, O impetuous ones... The Liftoglobin only moves when he feels a certain weight...
Only one person would not be heavy enough for him to move...
No, if you want to feel the globin in your hair as you ride Liftoglobin, bring two people!
One more note... Liftoglobin hates being left all alone.
If you leave Liftoglobin and go far from him, he will return to his original-ish spot in haste.
Should you lose your precious Liftoglobin, return here and have a teary globin reunion!
How go your Liftoglobin adventures, O jumpy ones?
Do you crave a Liftoglobin tutorial one more globin? 
Nah.
Teach me!
About what do you globin? 
How do I move him? 
How do I stop him? 
Something else. 
Never mind.
Chill Liftoglobin with icy breath, and slide the stylus in the direction you want him to move.
Always ride with two people, or Liftoglobin won't move a single, solitary globin.
To stop a moving Liftoglobin, just give him a light touch, and he'll screech to a globin!
He'll also stop if you get off him or jump while he's moving around the globin.
Liftoglobin hates being alone more than anything.
If you leave Liftoglobin's side and stray far away, he will return to his original spot.
My advice, O jumpy ones, is to not let Liftoglobin disappear from the screen.
Need anything else, O globin? 
About moving... 
About stopping... 
About something else... 
Nah, I'm good.
Hey! Look!
Isn't that the Star Cure?!
You got the second Star Cure!
It's a little sticky and gross from Bowser eating it...
Wash it REALLY well later...
I feel bad for Bowser, but we should head back outside.
We can't do anything in here.
One more Star Cure left...
Maybe Dr. Toadley knows where the third sage is...
Let's get back to Toad Town.
You got the blue key!
Skip minigame and proceed with story? 
No 
Yes
Heave! Ho!
Whoa!
Yep, Charlie here is my grandson. He just lost his memory, that's all.
All he could say was, "Where am I?" And also, "Who am I?"
Hey... This whirlwind...
Think you can use it?
Well, I mean, what if you just jumped into the middle of it?
Get any good ideas?
OK, so you'll switch to the Spin Jump icon with  or ...
Then Mario hops onto Luigi? Oh, right, by pressing .
Also, you can use the Circle Pad in the middle of a Spin Jump.
Where are you going? You gotta try this out!
Flab Zone Attack Pieces You got piece #!
Pieces left to find: 
Hmm... I see...
Let's try something new, shall we?
Remember, you can always talk to me if you need help.
Wow! That really powers up your jumping ability!

An entry was added to the Guide.
And that one's a luxury store...
You can buy gear at any of those three spots.
I've gotta go check 'em out myself! I love me some gear!
You want the skinny on other places too? 
Nah.
Please!
That place down there is a tasty-tea kiosk.
Royal shroom tea is the Flave o' the Day!
Sounds good, am I right? You've GOTTA try it!
Oh, and that pipe there goes to Toad Town Caves.
My toned bod! It's back, baby!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Mario! You try that yummy royal mushroom tea yet?

You got 300 coins!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Mario! You take a look inside Toadles Boutique yet?
You got 5 1-UP Mushrooms!
Mr. Mario! Are you wearing any gear? I sure hope so!
If you use your gear wisely, you'll have a big advantage!
Oh. You already knew that? Whoops, sorry.
You got 500 coins!
You got a Shield Badge!
Royal shroom tea is all full of syrup and mushroom flavors, and man, it's good...
They say it heals the spirit... I want my BOD healed! Gimme back my toned bod!
You haven't found the last of the Mushroom Balls!
You've got  left!

Don't need any.

Big thanks go out to Mario, who made it a huge success!

You got 5 Power Beans! You got 5 Speed Beans!
You got 2,000 coins!
You got Treasure Specs!
Nice! You found me! Like only Mario could!
But where am I next? C'mon! Try to find me!
Oog, I tried to roll to the entrance, but...
No good! All I can do is wiggle like this!
Am I in the way? But I can't move...
So how about it, you two? Find any Mushroom Balls?
In blocks you can't see... In the ground... Behind walls...
Snoop around suspicious places, and you'll find 'em!
Some you can only get by tunneling into the ground.
Remember! There are 16 of the Mushroom Balls total!
And as of right now...  left to find!
You haven't found the last of the Mushroom Balls!
You've got  left!
Mr. Mario! Mr. Luigi! Hello! To commemorate the mall opening, we have a PR stunt!
Wanna hear about it? 
Next time.
Let's hear!
Rumor has it that Dr. Toadley has some mysterious powers.
The guy knows everything about the Mushroom Kingdom...
If you're ever in a jam, I'd head over and ask that guy about it.
Anyway, that's all I got, my man! Take a stroll and have a blast!
It's a little something I like to call Mushroom Ball Derby!
We've hidden Mushroom Balls all over this shopping mall, and you bring 'em to me!
Here's the best part! You keep whatever's in the balls!
Trust me, it's brilliant PR. You'll be dying to open 'em!
Now, many Mushroom Balls may be invisible...
In blocks you can't see... In the ground... Behind walls...
Mario, I know you have a knack for this, so explore suspicious places...
Some you can only get by tunneling into the ground.
So yeah... That's it. They're hidden all over, so get to looking, you two!
Oh! And there are 16 of the Mushroom Balls total!
You got a Mushroom Ball!
You ever feel lost in this mall, you come see me!
I'm happy to guide you!
So how about it, you two? Find any Mushroom Balls?
In blocks you can't see... In the ground... Behind walls...
Snoop around suspicious places, and you'll find 'em!
Some you can only get by tunneling into the ground.
Remember! There are 16 of the Mushroom Balls total!
And as of right now...  left to find!
You want me to go over the mall shops? 
No.
Please!
Nice! Mushroom Ball score! Found  of 'em, huh?
Well, let's just take a peek inside and see what's what!
Simply fabulous shopping today, I must say...
Perhaps I'll redeem my free massage as well...
Rather a perfect end to a perfect day for a perfect Toad such as myself...
Nice! Score!
Just east of here is even more mall. Yeah, it's that big.
Even FARTHER east is the way out of Toad Town, but...
That way is under construction. Lots of construction lately.
You got 50 coins!
Just east of here is even more mall. Yeah, it's that big.
Go even FARTHER east to leave Toad Town.
You got 5 Super Mushrooms!
Coins alone don't run the world, you know! Nuh-uh!
I HEREBY VOW TO LIVE WITHOUT COINS!
You got 100 coins!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Mario! You meet Dr. Toadley yet?
You got 5 Supersyrup Jars!
You'll get something even better next time!
The grand prize of the event has yet to appear!
What do you think? Should be a snap for you!
Even Luigi can hit invisible blocks!
I sense a ball hidden on the eastern side!
Around the store... seems...suspicious...
Hey, a word of advice... Careful how you spend coins!
I bought a bunch of gear but then couldn't buy items...
Then I bought a badge and couldn't buy some gear...
You've gotta think it through! Shop smart, I'm telling you!
Keep your eyes peeled!
It might be good to keep jumping around, huh?
Found a lot, huh? Well, keep at it!
HP fully restored!
BP fully restored!
HP and BP fully restored!
Oh, shame, Mario... Not enough coins...
Hello and welcome to you both! It's Mario! And good old Luigi!
This is my humble tea counter!
Looks like your HP is running a bit low, huh?
I'd recommend the classic mushroom tea for you!
Ooh, BP is hurting, huh?
Well, what you need is milk mushroom tea, for sure!
I don't like the looks of this! HP and BP are both down!
This is a job that only royal mushroom tea can do!
Your HP and BP are both full! You two are feeling great, huh?
Well, if you lose that vigor, come on by for some tea!
Nice! Mushroom Ball score! Found  of 'em, huh?
Well, let's just take a peek inside and see what's what!
Yo! Mario, my man! Welcome to the mall!
The place just got built, and it's already jumping!
You want me to give you the rundown on the shops? 
Nah.
Sure!
OK, cool. First off, there are gear shops.
A small one over there...
That one there is bigger...
The timing is now... MIDBUS!
Lord Fawful...
Our waitings are at an end!
Bowser seeks the castle of Peach, and Fawful seeks him!
We must tempt him with the tastiness of jackpotting a lucky shroom...
Everything is ready.
Dieter!
That is me, yes!
Everything is under control and very efficient! Bowser's Castle is as good as yours.
Let me tell you some of the brags I have been saving in my head.
You can always count on the Best Fitness Friends when you are needing the muscle.
Soon all of the minions will be eating organic whey protein from the palm of your hand!
Oh, Fawful will be feeding them! Oh, yes!
And he will be feeding you the shiniest of gold coins if you are working fast!
Yes, we have a great appetite for your coin-givings, Lord Fawful...
And no one is faster! You will not find faster fitness friends!
...I see you are already in possession of much slower ones.
'Scuse me?
Oh! The slow piggy heard me! How will I ever escape his thundering slowness?
Midbus! Make with the hurrying!
You see? Or was that too fast for you? Toodles!
I'm not THAT slow...
Ugh... If you insist. But make it quick!
...just...trying...not to get sick. HURRP!
More important than being a Captain?!
Is that...even possible?
Hmm...
Kid still has some growing to do.
Bahahaha!
Excellent. Now, first of all, it's important to realize that if the leader of a battle falls, the battle will be lost.
Your little girly friend came to rescue your little crazy friend.
Hey! It's Roy!
This ain't over!
JUNIOR. MORTON HERE!
Duh.
Ugh...you're such a weirdo!
Yo, Roy! Sorry for being a jerk earlier. Looks like you crushed all these Minions, huh?
Whoa! What's the big idea, sneaking up on me like that?
And, if you defeat the enemy leader, the battle will be won.
IT IS YOU WHO ARE WEIRD!
...Anyway, please shut your little face while I reveal our plan.
If you so much as raise a tiny pinky finger against us...
We will throw your friend in the barrel somewhere very hot and stinky!
MORTON GIVE FOOD. EAT! EAT NOW!
Duh. Duh, duh, duh.
Let's go, my fellow former captains! Together we shall prevail!
RIGHT INTO THE LAVA!
Duh.
Hey, Cap. Whatever happened to that "game changer" you were goin' on about earlier?
Hey! Leave her out of this.
Duh, duh.
Oh. That. I...I didn't forget about it at all. It's just...
I have no idea if or when it will arrive.
Plus, I mean...lava? That's so unoriginal!
Allies and enemies all belong to one of three types: melee, ranged, or flying.
Use the captain command at just the right time....
Pay close attention to your Captain Points...
and this thing and that...
and blah blah blah...
and if this happens, then...
and blah blah blah...
...and that's all. Any questions?
So...you forgot. Or you never had one to begin with!
It's OK, Cap. We like you just the way you are.
I take that as a compliment!
Throwing people into lava is a classic move for a reason.
Because it works!
DUH!
If you don't change the game, it'll just stay the SAME!
Why couldn't you have just let us do our thing?
Oh! I mean...
What do you call it when our fearless Cap drops the ball?
It's a...CAPital offense! Get it? CAP?
Well, there's no denying his strength...
But...will it be enough...
Listen... We don't need a gimmick or a game changer or anything!
Let's show him what we're made of!
OK, so...after I left...
Why are we spending so much time on these exercises?
I'm with Roy...we've got better things to do!
I sort of...wandered around aimlessly for a while.
You can now use Roy, Morton, and Ludwig in battle!
Yeah...he's annoying as all get-out, but the kid can fight.
They should just let him sink or swim.
Then out of nowhere...these wild-eyed Minions started attacking me...
Sir! I...uh... Please tell me you didn't hear that!
I didn't know what else to do...so I started fighting.
I tried to make my way to the castle, but they kept coming in waves.
Stop blathering and get to your positions at once!
Lord Junior... My liege... LORD JUNIOR, LISTEN!
Sir! Yes, sir!
What, dude?
Well...you should get some rest.
You can now use Wendy and Iggy in battle!
Your Minion spirit...is on fire! A proud flame of Miniony hope!
Grrr!
No. I'm not finished.
All right, Lord Junior. It's OUR turn.
Uh...OK.
The anticipation is killing me!
Yoink!
You don't understand. It's just something I've gotta do.
Don't even follow me, guys. I got this.
I'm going back to the castle to set things straight!
You got past Cap? Guess it's my turn.
Yeah... Let's play!
Keheeheehee!
What is this?
C'mon, Roy...
Bring it on!
Wait, when did you guys get here?
And now the anticipation is boring me to death. Auf wiedersehen!
I've got you, Mistress Wendy!
Roy!
Lord Junior...Once again, your math seems to change a lot...
Who was that? I'm allergic to turnips!
Ahem. Lord Junior! Come now, we're taking our leave.
We need to head to Dimble Wood in search of the Giga-carrot.
Please try to remember...
Captain Koopa Troopa! Ready yourself to receive the package!
Hey! I'm talking to you! Are you giving me the silent treatment or what? I said I was sorry!
At least it wasn't a turnip this time...
Uh...
You can now use Larry in battle!
Dieter. It's time.
Captain Boo, at your service!
Sorry we took so long, Lord Junior!
Whoa! The castle is back!
Thank you, Minions!
You're my sparring partner for life, OK? Get used to it, buddy!
Those pink jerks are probably inside, messing around with dad's fancy barrels!
But, sir...
I'm pretty new to this comedy thing, but it's really working for me so far.
They say you just have to be brave and put yourself out there.
...
So...did you get it? Bow? Sir! Heh...
No. We are right here, messing around with your FACES!
All right, kid. I've wanted to do this for a while now. Let's go!
Don't ever leave the castle in case I wanna scrap, OK?
It's a play on a word... Hope it wasn't absurd...
Ugh, enough! I GOT IT.
Ooh...I can't believe you little meddlers have been meddling!
Sorry not sorry, Roy!
Sir, please...
Gonna craft that Skeletone... ♪ Bowser Jr. on his own... ♪
Find the carrot before those clowns... ♪ Cause I'm the one who wears the crown... ♪
So, you meet the real Leana. She's not so friendly, this one.
In fact, you might say...
Ugh...
What's the matter?! You don't like fighting me?
She's not friendly at all!
Wow! Young Master won...without inflicting serious damage.
N-no...that's not it...
Yeah, well... Guess what.
Oh no! Young Master!
What's your deal, anyway? You're a Captain for crying out loud!
We're not all lollipops and puppy dogs, either!
What happened? He was fine a second ago...
C'mon! Gimme one more match!
Yeah, really!
*sigh* Pull it together, Cap!
It must have taken everything he had to beat Roy.
Or until I win 20. Whichever comes last. Let's go!
Did you say something?
Lord Junior! I have an urgent update. I... I've given up rhyming. I'm all about jokes now!
This is your moment! What are you waiting for?!
Yeah. Looks like his body just gave out...
Oh, no... He still hasn't learned math...
Me? No, boss. Not me. Musta been Ludwig still yapping.
Come on, let's get going.
OK, here goes...
Bowser walks into a café and orders a coffee. The barista asks for his name.
Bowser says "Bowser," of course, but then the barista starts bowing!
Bowser's like, "What are you doing?" and the barista says, "You told me to bow, sir."
Just hold on a minute... It's all coming back to me.
I just practiced this morning...
OK, yes... I can feel the memory returning...slowly...
He didn't want us to know he was past his limit.
Finally!
Please, take all of the time you need. This is riveting, truly.
It's not working! Ugh...I've failed as his guardian...
Young Master! Please wake up!
Ugh...come on, guys!
Yes! Crushed it. Let's keep going!
Don't lose faith. We'll get this done, even if it takes all night. Which it might.
Milord, you've come so far. But your math...
All right, buddy. Just know that I'm doing this out of love...
It leaves much to be desired...
I'm gonna have to take you down!
Bravo, bravo. How exciting. Now come and get us!
All right, Roy... Listen...
Everyone! Calm down!
Of course! All right, let's see...
Those guys...really care about me...
Hey, I got it. You don't need to say anything.
The four of us will join Lemmy and save Bowser's Castle! So it shall be!
Well played, fluffy hair. Well played.
Um...
Yes, they're good and loyal servants.
They once rescued your father from a dire situation in the Beanbean Kingdom.
You can count on them, Lord Junior.
No, seriously...
It is our honor and privilege to fight alongside you, Lord Junior!
Heh...not bad yourself. I could tell it wasn't your first pose-off.
I forgot my lines!
I GOT IT. You're the boss's kid. I'll fall in line.
Amateurs. The both of them.
Grrr! That's not it!
No? What else is there to say?
Oops.
How did he escape?!
But in the end, she was no match for me!
I'm sorry!
...I'M BEEF.
Oh, it was so sad and so beautiful at the same time.
Ahem... Take note, evildoers!
I didn't...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Aaugh! I'm gonna be sick!
I almost cried tears of real schadenfreude and hot shame.
We are...
I didn't do it... for...Lord Junior.
I wasn't expecting that.
Lord Junior! Let's go over what we just learned.
I know that voice!
But I did not! Because I am Dieter.
The Elite Captain Quartet! Champions of Minion spirit!
Wait a second...
Where have you been keeping that thing?
Ah, who cares. Food is food!
Dude, have you been paying attention? I'm crushing it! I don't need your help.
Oh, honey...you better not do that again!
Teehee! That was fun.
And...HERE GOES NOTHIIING!
Of course it is! You're my sparring buddy until the end of time!
Eh? I know sparring with me is your favorite thing.
Wendy joined as a minion!
ROY! What's wrong with you?!
Is that a drumstick? Gimme, gimme!
Lord Junior...we need to get out of here. Let's move Roy to somewhere safe.
You got a Charred Spicy Drumstick!
So Roy charged in and knocked out all those Minions by himself? That's nuts!
Hold on. This is all burnt! What'd you do to it?
It seems so. It does sound like something Roy would do.
...MORTON COOK WITH FIRE. MORTON STRONG! BUT FIRE MORE STRONG.
Lord Junior! Only child of our beloved Lord Bowser!
We're here. It's TIME. Prepare your royal self to take on all four of us!
To think...he still wanted to help Lord Junior...after how things went down...
OK, big guy. I'll, uh, eat it later...
Oh. You finally shut up!
Hey, Morton... What are those dumb flags about, anyway?
YOU TELL 'EM, KALEY!
And now he's in need of some kind of healing.
You know, he's smarter than he looks. And sounds. He's trying to get in good with Lord Junior!
Lord Junior, this is important!
THOSE MINION CAPTAINS! ORIGINAL CAPTAINS.
GRR! IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EASY!
Lord Junior!
Good for him. But me? I just wanna go home.
I ain't the babysitting type.
Did you not hear me? DUH! I got it all!
Captains? THOSE guys?!
WHAT SHE SAID!
Roy! Can you hear us?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Easy, Roy. That's the boss's kid.
How's this working out for you? Pretty good?
SMALL MINIONS, BIG HEARTS!
CAPTAIN MINIONS EVEN SAVE LARGE BOWSER ONE TIME!
Hey! Shell boys and wizard hat! We've got a surprise for you...
Oh, the sweet delicious tragedy...
Your true love, trapped in a barrel. And you, unable to help.
Take it easy, Roy. Tell us what happened.
Whatever you say.
Just tell me who to punch!
Point taken...
They saved Dad? Huh.
Beef time!
Why don't you try something, hmm? Scared of the lava bath?
Hmph. You're not so different from him, you know...
Why don't you let me try a different approach?
NO WORRY, SMALL BOWSER! MORTON BELIEVE IN YOU!
Lord Junior! Forget about me... Take these guys out!
All right. But remember Lord Bowser's instructions!
Already forgotten! Hahah!
Ha, HA! How'd ya like THAT?
Can't spell Bowser Jr. without OW! Ha!
Shut up! She's not my true love!
But...I'm not leaving her behind!
Representing Lord Bowser...
Ha! Larry...
You actually thought you could beat me? Bwahaha!
Lord Junior...
LINE?!
Oh yeah...
Ugh...he's annoyingly strong.
Bro! Try to salvage a shred of dignity here!
We've been here the whole time! Get your lenses checked, fool!
You feel it too, don't you?
But...look how slow you're walking. I order you to knock it off!
Hah!
Good luck with that approach, Wendy.
It's too quiet around here.
All right! Bowser Jr.'s gonna get 10 wins, baby. Let's do it!
Hmph! That's one less fool for me to deal with. Now, where was I?
Oh, yeah. LET'S DO THIS!
There's going to be a fight. None of us can stop it.
*sigh* Yes, sir...
She's definitely the scariest of all of us.
Maybe she can actually teach him a lesson!
I just thought...if they're both at full strength, perhaps it will end in a draw.
And then these FOOLS can go back to being teammates...and friends.
Whoa! That was close!
I'm gonna make that Skeletone... ♪ And dad's gonna know I'm on my own! ♪
Now you listen here, Lord Junior...
Ahahaha!
Wait, were you being serious?
Right you are! Let's go...
Whoa! What was that for?
Sir, it's time to leave. Um...are you ready?
Oh, it's you! You wanna tussle again?
...to Bowser's Castle. Soon to be Fawful's Castle!
And then...FITNESS CASTLE!
Now you're fully recovered.
Aww, c'mon. One more!
Lord Junior... Please understand that I'm only following orders here...
So, young Bowser Jr. set off to find the ingredients necessary to cure the blorbs and impress his father.
Oh, if only I could have mentored the young prodigy a little more...perhaps things would have turned out differently.
You're welcome, Mistress Wendy!
Sorry about barreling into the fray like that, but glad we could help!
Kamek! What are you doing?!
Heh. You guys put up a good fight!
Ha ha!
What's that supposed to mean? I'll stomp ya!
And despite his miserable attitude, everything is going according to plan.
Now, let's hurry along into battle. Actions speak louder than words.
...Did you really just say that?
Um...Lord Junior...
What can I say? I'm a barrel of laughs!
Who are you calling a fool?
Oh, you are breaking my cold and crusty heart!
Does this look like open mic night?
See? They're perfectly matched now.
So, what will you do, small spiny one?
No, it's more like open fight night, am I right?
Yo! Ludwig!
Why are you so boring? You're messing up a perfectly good fight with all your yapping!
Put me back in the dang barrel.
*sigh* Lord Junior...I'm trying to teach you about squads.
When you line things up just right, your combined power can be incredible.
This is known as SPIRIT, and it is super important!
Get it?!
Honestly, I now prefer the turnips.
You're doing it again! Shut up!
I've got plenty of spirit. Dad always says so!
I'll fight you if you keep trying to teach me how to fight!
Bow! Sir! Bowser?!
Can everyone please stop telling jokes and start actually helping?!
Lord Junior... if you would just listen...
Duh! You should believe in me. I can beat any Goomba any day!
Oh, really?
Now that you ask... I'm up for the task!
Hey, Cap! Will you do the honors?
You're STILL talking?!
Those dumb captain flags don't scare me. They're going DOWN.
Ha!
Chin up, Private Goomp!
Oh, brother...
He really is a chip off the old block...
Huh!
Captain Goomba joined as a minion!
HA!
It's an HONOR to be Lord Junior's punching ba—er, best friend...
Well then!
Captain Shy Guy joined as a minion! 
After a while, it got to me.
Can you imagine? Having to battle through wave after wave of your former friends?
Then my mind sort of went blank...
I can barely walk, kid. You think this is your chance to beat me? Is that it?
There they are. Get 'em!
Whew! That was rough!
Well then!
Captain Boo joined as a minion!
When I came to, I was here at the castle. I had made it...somehow...
Young Master! You need your rest!
Private Goomp! Hang in there!
Pfft!
Captain Koopa Troopa joined as a minion!
Come back here!
Hey! Captain Goomba! You want in on this?
What?! I'm the best! Of course I'm ready!
Nah, c'mon.
You're just my Goomba punching bag! You exist to entertain me, right?
Hmph!
Hmph.
Gah!
GET DA CURE. CURE DA BLORBS!
Come to think of it, I never did get that 20th victory...
Super!
Roy has rejoined your squad...kind of?
Private Goomp joined your squad!
Sergeant Guy joined your squad!
Corporal Paraplonk joined your squad!
I said I got it! Yeesh!
Remind me, we gotta fight 15 more times when we get back!
Great!
Lord Junior, it's just that...
Bahaha! I love this.
Count on them? I just don't want them taking all the credit!
So now you get to do it forever! That reminds me...
I need 30 more wins against you!
No. Not happening.
LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
OK, OK...you still are not the winners, losers!
We have our own minions, and they are even more annoying and have worse jokes!
We even converted that monosyllabic monster to our side. You know him as Morton!
It's been a while, kid. I thought maybe you grew up.
Guess I was wrong. You're still just a brat.
Man! What a piece of work.
Lord Junior...I'm sorry I got captured.
Thanks for bailing me out.
Hmph. Thought so. Don't try and stop me.
Yes, well...that went about how I expected.
Don't thank me yet.
We still need to find Roy and Morton.
Oh yeah, and crush those guys for messing with Dad's castle!
Huh...
Dieter! Status report!
Right. Well, let's get to it!
I'm happy to report that everything is...
Lord Junior! Us Boos are ready and waiting!
Excuse me, Lord Junior?
Did...did we do an OK job?
Yeah, I don't like it.
The place should be crawling with hypnotized Minions.
Then at least we'd know what to do.
Groovy.
Oh, yeah! You guys were great.
Something's not right.
He straight up apologized to you! Can you believe it?
In other words... LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
So does that mean...
You'll restore my Captaincy? Like...officially? With paperwork and a flag and all that jazz?
You guys are crazy. This is gonna be super easy!
...I don't, actually.
But this can help you, um... "crush it" even more.
Wendy! What are you doing in that barrel?!
Nope!
I've got something more important in mind for you.
See? Look at these guys. Napping! It's a cakewalk!
If he's so sorry, why'd he just run off?
You remember who his dad is, right? Take what you can get!
ABOVE YOU!
Huh? It's dark out! Bedtime already?
...Huh. So what's this about my castle?

Move like this...
If you make yourselves slide with the stylus, you'll repel the pollen.
Use the pollen to change all the nasal walls' colors!
Mario! Careful! Don't hit the spiky pollen!
That's why Bowser's nose was itching!
Then you'll move on the path the stylus slid!
Whoa!
Be careful not to lose all your hearts!
When the pollen hits the walls, they change color!
Next, you guys should slam into the swollen membrane! Do it!
Oh, that's pollen raining down...
And bounce all the pollen into the walls!
Like, say you trace this path for you two...
You think we'll affect his body if we knock that pollen into his nasal walls?
If you hit a spiky pollen, you lose one heart...
Wow, that's quite a serious reaction...
This is a different kind of pollen!
Dad's back!
Ugh... Well, at least it wasn't load bearing.
This is gonna cost me.
Boy, this renovation needs to happen NOW...
Dad got all round and big, and then--BOOOM! He trashed that wall!
You think I'll get big like Dad someday?
Now, honey! No more eating weird mushrooms!
You aspire to travel? 
Don't travel.
Travel.
Yeah, so our secret tunnel mission is going super smooth!
Secret tunnel?! First I heard of it!
Oh, WAAH! Some minions you are! Fine, I'll do it myself!
You, uh... You sure about this, bro?
HRRRRNNGH!
Bros.
What was that?
He activated the drill battery. Runs for 1 minute 30 seconds.
If it runs out, he's gotta head back and get a new one...
They're pricey too, brodeo-- 50 coins a pop!
Looks like Bowser's taking care of business for us.
Well... As long as he makes it to Toad Town within 1 minute 30 seconds!
Complete and utter collapse, brodingtons! All Bowser's progress got filled in!
ARGH, IT NEVER ENDS!
Whatever. Just gotta reach Toad Town in 1 minute 30 seconds.
You're going down, dirt!
Cry me a river! I have no cash!
Hey, it's all good, brodleby. We'll cover you for now.
Just hit us back later.
ミニゲーム失敗

Remember, bro--I mean Bowser? You wanted an escape tunnel for kidnapping Peach?
The big tunnel project... You named it Project K!
And you handed it off to us, the Monty Bros., because we rule dirt!
Hmm, I guess I remember something like that.
But you guys don't rule squat! I was just watching you chumps, and you're getting nowhere!
You're total slackers!
I-I-I... Look, sorry, brogurt!
We're all lined up to connect to Toad Town if we go straight through here, but...
Broyo, this dirt is crazy hard! It's a dead end, I kid you not!
Wait, we can connect to Toad Town through here?!
Yeah, broham! Straight through there!
Nice! Then get on it! Make with the digging!
But, bro, the dirt's so hard...
What kind of cruddy battery only lasts 1 minute 30 seconds?!
Broshi, that drill eats power in a big way...
Make it work again!
Uh, bro--I mean, Bowser?
We paid 50 coins for each spare battery...
I'll cover it! Hurry it up!
Huh?!
Bro! Check it out!
Sounded like a cave-in, bros. I hope that path Bowser just dug didn't collapse...
Oh, bro!
C'mon, bro! We've made ZERO progress in forever!
Beef up that drill power again, will ya?
I'm maxing it out right now, broski!
Keep at it, broham! Gotta get it done!
We're a force of nature handpicked by Bowser!
Bros do NOT get defeated by some stupid dirt wall!
Hey! What's going on?!
Buh-Bowser?!
Buh-bros! Take five!
Are you at the beach yet?
Remember, the third sage is atop a cliff!
FYI! FYI!

A great beast slouches by...
 It is you, who is he.
What? What is this?
Ah. Search not, for I am not there.
How would one describe me? I am...the voice within.
Stop talking!
Ah. So very unenlightened. Anger will get you nowhere.
GAH! SHUT UP!
 I bear you no ill will.
When you find Chakroads on your travels, touch them.
You cannot find Chakroads by merely walking around.
They hide their waves, their energy, their very essence.
 Break things to find them.
One can only travel to Chakroads one has found.
If an area's Chakroad is hidden, you go there not.
 It is the way of the mind...
How amusing. Yes... You are surprised.
When you find a Chakroad, your mind bonds to it...
Not too shabby!
Brain guy! Take me to Bowser Castle, and make it snappy!
 Then you can travel.
 This is beyond even me.
TOO MANY WORDS.
 You are unenlightened.
Not that I care, but who are you, really?
Our minds have bonded. This is a rare thing.
 So rare that I will teach you.
It matters not where you go, for I will speak my piece.
I am your consciousness...
I am above, and all around. I am all that is you.
A consciousness bound to you, as you are to me.
 Shall we travel together?
Hey buddy? You make NO SENSE! Enough with the crazy talk!
A conduit for energy waves that bond earth to space.
Teach me what? Hurry up!
Smash that boulder to see. Use your inner strength.
And so it springs to life. That is called a Chakroad.
Fret not about the details. Just touch that Chakroad...
Be still in body and mind. Be one with immobility.
You aspire to travel? 
Don't travel.
Travel.
Who am I...
 And now I go.
Hey!
I exist somewhere in this kingdom, and that is all.

You lugged yourself up onstage, huh? Nice!
Now I can give these folks a REAL show!
BWAHAHAHA!
That's right! Lemme hear it! Keep those cheers coming!
You remember me now, I bet! The unbeatable King Bowser!

Ah, our winner! The king, Bowser... Looks promising!

Old pink was just a warm-up! Now I punt you outta here!

We're on it, sir! This way, please, King Bowser!
It is an entrance of amazement! Like only a special guest does!

Fawful is also feeling it!
I am needing to feel it even more, though!
MORE!

Oh, I am feeling the power! It high-fives Fawful's face!
And now I will use that power to call our most special guest, who you will be cheering!

Lord Fawful's autograph session is now over.
If you want an autograph, notify us before the show.
Look, pal, you'll have to get Lord Fawful's autograph after the show! He's getting ready!
Why's Lord Fawful doing a show while he's plotting the conquest of the Mushroom Kingdom?
Well, gosh... Everyone needs a hobby, right?
You hear this? Fawful's special modifications let this castle fly through the sky! Wow!
This guy said there was a flight a second ago, but I was having this sweet nap, so I missed it...
Man... Huge bummer!
I've gotta tell everyone I know about this theater. The coolness of Lord Fawful must ring out!
Next time I'll bring friends... Wait... Do I have any friends?
Aaaah... Killer show. I'm beat.
But I gotta get tickets for the next show right now!
If you asked what Lord Fawful's best feature was, I'd have to say those sweet, swirly glasses!
Those swirls show the cyclical nature of the world, am I right? Now THAT is deep fashion!
Lord Fawful's best feature has gotta be those incredible polished teeth! No doubt!
In those spotless, shiny teeth, we see our very souls reflected! They're our greatest treasure!
O globins, are you collecting those Attack-ish Pieces?
My soul weeps for those who seek Attack Pieces here...
For woe be to the traveler who consults the useless map!
But if that traveler keeps his eyes open, he'll find them all...
Maybe even near-ish here!

I like to wake up and gaze at Peach's picture...
But then the other day... I had a dream that Peach came down with the blorbs.
Since then, I've been a little antsy about looking at that picture...
Nah, we're good. Now scram!
...Huh? What's that?
Morton! Explain yourself before I get any crankier!
No kidding. But for now, let's leave him to his carrot obsession and keep moving.
After all, we're BFF... The BRUTE FORCE FEDERATION!
Rude. Are you SURE you're all right?
Oh, forget it. I've really got to get going.
Duh! I was gonna say that! Stop trying to take credit!
Oh, come on, Beef. What's the matter? Does your widdle tum-tum hurt? Aww...
Well...GET OVER IT!
Where's Dieter?
Now, before we move out...
While I was undercover as Beef, I determined that the other Koopalings are at Blubble Lake.
So...let's head that way now. Move out! And stay alert...
Ludwig rejoined your squad!
Hey! Are you nuts, or what?
You were just barkin' commands at us and we had to take you down a couple pegs.
Wendy and Larry left!
Don't act like you were still practicing. I could tell you were trying hard!
Oh, no! I suppose I've undersold it. The castle is DOOMED!
Run for your lives! RUN!
Bahaha!
Save yourselves! And a minion or two while you're at it!
♪Got carrots on the braaaain! Your loss will be my gaaaaain!♪
But, but, but... Where's Beef?
UGH! There aren't any stupid carrots stupid anywhere!
I sort of...wandered around aimlessly for a while.
...WHY WON'T YOU TELL ME WHERE BEEF IS?
I don't have to answer that!
Then out of nowhere...these wild-eyed Minions started attacking me...
But seriously... WHERE IS BEEF?
I didn't know what else to do...so I started fighting.
I tried to make my way to the castle, but they kept coming in waves.
This isn't happening...
...I'm lost without Beef...
They're here! The Minions have arrived!
Lord Junior... You sure you're OK?
Yes, you fell right into my trap.
I used myself as bait to lure you out here into the forest.
Stop right there, you! That's far enough!
You're STILL talking? Ugh, get outta here!
Though, to be honest... I never expected to find Lord Junior out here!
Who do you think you're talkin' to?
LORD JUNIOR... I TRIED TO HELP.
DON'T SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT MORTON.
Looks like the Minions are back in business!
Take THIS! And THAT!
Why do you have my magic brush?!
LORD JUNIOR. MORTON FORGOT. BROUGHT THIS FOR YOU.
Maybe they were, like, hypnotized or something...
I mean...just kidding, guys! Ahaha...ha...
SORRY AGAIN.
Ooh! This is NOT happening!
♪I gotta find that caaaarrot! So big you can't compaaaare it!♪
...Understood.
Ludwig? Ludwig! I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME!
Hmph. That kid is gettin' under my shell. The things I put up with for Lord Bowser.
Ludwig...
The young Master has come a long way since you saw him last.
So I hope you realize that this is his way of saying he forgives you.
No kidding.
Yes...I'm proud of him.
You can now change Bowser Jr. to a Ranged type in the Formation menu!
UGH! Enough with the weepy reunion!
Beef or no Beef, I'm still the fittest one here!
WHAT?! No, that's totally not OK!
But enough talk.
It's time to face the music, lady. And my piano's all tuned up.
Heh, I think not. Listen up, lady.
I know.
Who knows... Maybe he'll actually listen to you...
Your secret. I know it.
I KNEW IT!
HALT! We can't let you go a step further!
Watch it, Ludwig. She seems like she's about to blow...
No, no. It's probably nothing.
Relax! Watching Junior is easy...ish.
Oh, hello there! Are you a fellow veggie lover? It's such a fresh and sustainable love, isn't it?
Yeesh, this again...
Ugh, it was so easy. What a wimpy little castle to commandeer!
They just fell right for our plan...
"Oh, excuse me! I'll just lure all the tough guys out here and leave your base defenseless!" Ha!
And your mouth...
You try to keep it under control, but when you're mad...
It all just busts loose, doesn't it? Your temper is your weakness!
SHUT UP!
Still... Let me just check something out. The kid's your responsibility until I return.
My family has been raising tasty veggies here for generations. Welcome to Wiggler Family Farm!
Eat THIS!
Now we can take out the Koopalings and Bowser Jr. at our leisure.
I'm sure our meaty friend Beef has already dispensed with Ludwig...
How dare you question my fitness and my composure!
I'll tie you to the squat rack by your tongue!
♪The forest's biggest caaaarrot! It will be mine, I sweaaaar it!♪
Ludwig left your squad!
Well now. That seems extreme.
RAAAAARGH!
OK, I think Ludwig was right. This is definitely not normal.
What is making them attack us and then get amnesia?
Huh? Dad?
Hello! Yes, hello, my friends! Are we feeling healthy and fit?
And how goes the search for Skeletone Formula:D ingredients?
Yikes!
What do you want?
What was that crazy wind all about? What's going on here?!
All I want is for my clients to become their perfect selves!
Oh, and... I have some info that might be a teeeeensy bit hard to swallow.
You know that castle that Bowser lives in? I believe it's called...Bowser's Castle?
Yeah...it's definitely under attack.
Young Master!
Roy, stop.
WHAT?!
Let's all just calm down.
So...Lord Bowser ate a weird mushroom and is now inhaling everything in sight?
We JUST got here. Patience is a virtue, honey.
That's for me to know and you to panic about.
Correct! He was tricked by a strange entity with even stranger speaking tendencies.
After he ate it, he started inhaling anything and ANYONE in the vicinity. Truly terrifying!
That's why I, uh...immediately evacuated in search of help. It was a selfless act of heroism.
Heh. I've actually learned a lot sneaking around with you guys.
Can't wait to report back to Lord Bowser... We might borrow some of your techniques!
I...I gotta tell you something. I made a promise to Kamek.
I'm not gonna let those guys get away with this.
I'm gonna save all of us Koopalings and the Minions. No matter what.
Did you say veggies? CARROTS are veggies! Show me your carrots, bug brain!
Heh. I don't doubt it, kid.
Wow! I love your enthusiasm for vegetables! They ARE exciting, aren't they?
Well, if it's fresh, sustainably scrumptious carrots you're after, they're in the field over yonder.
She's right, Roy. Don't let the kid get to ya.
But on the down low, I feel the same way.
I don't think you understand. We need the Giga-carrot! Do you have that?
Bah! Grow a spine, Larry! He only cares about himself!
He'll never appreciate or respect us. I'm over it! Work it out, kid! 
You're not as fit as you wish you were.
In fact, you've been relying on some pretty shady substances...
Grrr! Who needs you, anyway?
Ludwig was feeling the same way, right before he ran off to who knows where.
Oh, joy! You have incredible taste in vegetables. The Giga-carrot is a marvel of agriculture.
It's ultra enormous and fabulously farm fresh. Wiggler's been raising that veggie baby for years.
Eww! No one's talking about EATING carrots, bug! I just need the Giga-carrot to impress my dad.
Now, if you've got some hot wings or a nice, juicy steak...
What's the deal, Morton? Explain yourself!
Don't tell me you're siding with that baby!
And I will...also stay! I'm hungry for carrots!
Bahahaha!
But if you ask me? You guys are losing it.
You'll find it further back beyond the vegetable field.
Oh, how your excitement excites me! It seems our carrot-promoting efforts have not been in vain!
Ooh! Hold me back! I mean, lemme at him!
Oh dear! Don't you friends get along? How sad, how very sad.
It's getting a teensy bit tense here, so I'll take my leave.
They said, "You'll never get today's youth to eat their own weight in carrots."
But look who's laughing a big, carroty laugh now!
We should go, too. Come on, Wendy.
Good riddance! Hmph. I'm outta here.
Yeah... Let's go.
You know perfectly well where Dieter is, you overblown bicep! He's guarding Bowser's Castle!
We...attacked you? Just now? Thaaat is strange. I don't remember that at all. Please believe me!
If you flakes wanna flake out on me too, go right ahead.
I can do this all by myself.
Good luck, guys.
Oh... Well, then...
We were just patrolling the forest, as usual.
And then we saw young Master Bowser and...
Well...some of the guys wanted his autograph...
Bwahaha!
Roy abandoned Bowser Jr.!
Oh, should I have told them that the castle is under Lord Fawful's control? Oopsie!
OK, what's actually the matter? In case you didn't notice, I just declared war on these guys.
That means I need your gluteus maximus in gear!
This place is crawling with weaklings. Pathetic. This is such a cakewalk.
Yes! Everything is falling into place!
And I'm feeling absolutely no side effects from those homemade energy pills. WHEEEEE!
Oh! That one is a good one! Now, let us give Lord Fawful the full report.
Bahaha! Didn't see that coming!
Happy now? You've been looking for me, right?
Come on, you have to admit it was a good disguise.
I couldn't let you creeps just roam around the kingdom unsupervised.
Looks like spying on you was the right call.
HA! Haha...ha? Wait, where am I?
...Oh! What an honor! Lord Junior, hello!
Wha... Whaaaaa... Where are we?
I know you've been tailing Lord Junior in order to swipe the Skeletone at the last minute.
Ugh, now what?
Oh, my! It's Lord Junior!
And that you were planning on using it to take control of the Minions!
Oh, great. Now Kamek is gonna talk my ears off...
Bwaha, that was waaaay too easy.
I'm too strong for my own good. It's my princely curse.
And you waited all this time to give it to me?!
Well, we can fix one of those problems right now, can't we?
I even know that you're planning on betraying Fawful!
You want the whole Mushroom Kingdom, don't you?
Riiiight. That's definitely a factor.
But didn't it also help that Morton stepped in to protect you?
Are you completely worthless or what? Why are good minions so hard to find!
Hey, Beef! Back me up, big guy!
Pfffft! Yeah, right! Morton just got in my way. He's such a glory stealer.
Go right ahead!
...OH. MORTON SORRY.
I've had enough!
You're selfish and rude. That's MY thing!
I'd rather explain myself to Lord Bowser than put up with you a second longer!
What? You've switched to musical metaphors? What does that even mean?!
Hm. I can't shake the feeling that someone's following us...
Oh. Goodness, no. If you only eat meat, your poor body won't get the nutrients it needs!
Lord Junior.
I had to leave your side to do what I did.
Maybe it's just my imagination.
And if you make fun of vegetables, well, I can't vouch for your safety.
I hope you can forgive me.
HEY! What's the holdup back there?!
If you deem it necessary...
I'm willing to accept whatever punishment you find appropriate.
Yeah, right. Did you hit your head, honey?
Well...
Spill it, Ludwig. What's going on?
You think ALL of these losers hit their heads at the same time?!
You did walk out on me. Just like that! That's unforgivable!
I feel like we're being followed. And I'm worried that something's wrong back at the castle.
I really can't remember a thing... I'm sorry, Master! Forgive me, Mistress!
From now on...you're not allowed to leave me no matter what!
Just...just follow me everywhere, got it?
Why would you think that?
Besides, we left Lemmy back there. He can manage a few blorbed Goombas, can't he?
Hey! I'm bored again. Let's go!
Yeah, well...it's just a feeling. I also feel like we're being watched. Like...right now.
Select Bowser Jr. and press  to change his type.
...Whatever.
You sure you feeling OK? You're not about to blorb out on us, are you?
Well, somethin' fishy is goin' on, and I don't like the smell of it.
Wendy. Larry. I'm bailing on this plan and this kid.
Best of luck to you guys. You'll need it.
See ya. Wouldn't wanna be ya.
Roy! Did you not hear me? I'm BORED! Hurry up!
Oh, for cryin' out loud...
You heard the kid. Let's get going.
Theeeere it is. Now that she's completely unhinged, we can turn the tables.
After a while, it got to me.
Can you imagine? Having to battle through wave after wave of your former friends?
Then my mind sort of went blank...
Noooo...
Lord Junior. Take this.
Yeah right. If we weren't here...
Little Lord Junior would be forest fertilizer by now.
Any remaining minions should already have joined Lord Fawful by now.
Which means those FOOLS will be defeated by their own friends. HA!
Hmm? What is it?
WHAT did you say?!
Hey, Roy! Underling! I heard that!
Ooh, I wish I could watch it all go down...
It's an antidote. I call it RenewaLeaf.
They've been controlling Morton with a contaminated version of your Skeletone!
This stuff will bring him and the others back to normal.
Ooooh, Is the little brat mad at me? I'm shakin' in my shell!
You're the only one who thinks you're tough, kid. To me, you're just a wanna-Bowser.
Well...I don't mean to alarm you. I'm sure it'll be fine!
There were just a few of those spooky UFOs, maybe a Mega mecha or twenty...
Ah, yes, of course. The big blob himself.
Whatever you say, man.
Watch it, buddy! If you keep this up, I'll...I'll...
That sounds familiar...
Not to worry. He's sleeping soundly in a storage room at Bowser's Castle.
You got RenewaLeaf!
OK, then. Let's head out!
Whatever, dude. Where's Dad now?
I'll tell Dad!
All right, she's hysterical, but we should probably check it out.
Hey, Ludwig!
Lord Bowser is....somewhere. That much is certain. But I have no idea where.
Yeah, but...we're stuck with the kid right now.
All right, so... Where's Ludwig?
Yeah?
Figures. I almost never know where Dad is. I'm basically a latchkey Koopa.
I HEARD THAT, TOO!
Pfft, don't worry about ME. I can find the ingredients myself.
I didn't want your help anyway.
I don't know, but we must find him before those fitness freaks get their freaky fit fingers on him!
Yes, well...His Busyness is very...busy.
Lord Junior... I know you're in charge, but not even your dad talks to us like that...
Well, what do we have here?
You lot!
I'm leaving the young Master in your care while I seek Bowser.
C'mon, Wendy. It's not worth it. Let's hurry back to the castle.
The kid says he doesn't need us. Let him prove it.
You aren't Ludwig. And you're still alive!
Morton? Iggy? You coming?
Is something the matter?
Blah blah blah! Keep your loser problems to yourself. And don't talk back to your future king!
What a weirdo.
MORTON...STAY WITH LORD JUNIOR.
LET'S GIVE 'EM A WORKOUT!

Huh? A ship?
If I punched that ship... it could break that wall!
HEY!
Pfft!
What, you thought your little castle-bot would crush me?
Who do you think I am, buddy? I'm Bowser, the Koopa king!
Please! Try again in about a hundred years, you weird little babbling nerd!
Don't lump me with Mario!
What a joke! That guy was too weak to even call an enemy!
Yeah, looked like it. Why? What of it?
Wait... Speaking of...
Fawful sucked up some of the dark power, right?
Oh. Yeah. That'd be bad.
He's still too weak to be called my enemy, though!
Fawfully-doo!♪
Where are you?!♪
Dark Star, needing you!♪
Dark power, yoo-hoo!♪
WHERE TO FIND YOU...♪
I have shock at you! You are surviving?
Fawful hates you!
But I am Lord Fawful! I am ruling the world!
I have chortles...
You are underestimating Fawful, who has the suction machine for draining the dark power!
Fawful only got half the power, but I am thinking it is enough to KO you, the king of stupid!
You have gotten in Fawful's way at each of the turns...
Just like the red and green mustaches who I hate...
Fawful hates your faces...
But... Now...
BWAHAHA!
Bad why?
So, you defeated Fawful, huh?
I wonder if Fawful will behave himself now...
Ooh... I've got a bad feeling about this...
So both Fawful and Dark Bowser have some dark power within them...
So... If... If...
If Dark Bowser inhales what remains of Fawful...
The dark power will finally be whole!
And if it adds that dark power to the abilities it copied from you...
Pitiful...
    
If only that were true...
Fawful says farewell to all your fink-rat faces forever!
Bowser! Meet...
FURY OF FAWFUL!
NOOAAAARGH!
Fury?
I have fury?
This is a test.

Masters Mario and Luigi! You're hale and hearty!
After that great lout inhaled me, I awoke a bit addlepated...
I walked hither and thither, and now I've become quite stuck!
Hey! Where's Princess Peach? Isn't she with you?
WHAT?! The princess?! Don't tell me she was inhaled as well!
Yes... Bowser got everyone. Ugh, we're in a real fix.
Even Toadsworth doesn't know where the princess is...
Horrors... The princess... It rends the heart!
All alone within Bowser's body...
On her own amid such filth...
DEAR PRINCESS!
Huh? Oh, yeah, right. We need to get Toadsworth out of here. He's lost it.
The shame...
Huzzah! Sweet freedom! Master Mario! Master Luigi! My deepest thanks!
I daresay Master Mario and co. will now seek the princess, hm?
Marvelous. Simply marvelous! The princess must be made safe at all costs!
Speaking of which...
I should tell you, as I made my way here, I spotted a huge, flat bug by some sort of door.
It was wretched, to be sure! I shudder to think of it, but if it attacked the princess...
Righto! With that large, foul bug in the sure hands of Masters Mario and Luigi, I shall be off!
I believe it would behoove us all if I were to find the other Toads and glean what I can.
Help the princess! I count upon you!
I see. I get it now.
If there's something you don't know, just come talk to me.
First, switch the action icon to your hammer by pressing  or .
Then press  to have Luigi hit Mario. Not too hard!

Really, really bad. 
Normal.
Really? REALLY? Typical globin. Do as you will, O witless ones!
Wander for the rest of your lives, and weep foolish tears!
Without further globin, it's the Bowser Brain Train!
O rule-ish rules, what are you?
The crucial one is to be globin. After that, the questions. You ask Bowser many questions!
I don't mind telling you that his answers and those in the quiz may be very similar-ish.
But free it is not! Is anything, in this odd, globin world? No. Bowser questions cost 5 coins.
Say your globin shines forth and you answer everything right! Then you win! I show the way.
But wait, O impatient one. One wrong-ish word halts the train. And I show you NOTHING.
And worse, a penalty lurches forth out of the mists of globin! You'll battle for my pleasure!
Then let the globin begin! Oh, but first...
The questioning... Yes, you ask Bowser questions. He will hear you by the power of globin.
I don't mind telling you that his answers and those in the quiz may be very similar-ish.

I could tell the correct-ish way to you. That would be globin...
But oh, I am nuts! I am naughty! So says the world and globin! So I offer no hint-ish things!
That is, unless you have quality time with Nutsoglobin. Then I may tell the correct-ish way.
More, you ask? There may be a great-ish bonus for you as well, and that is the globin.
So, hang out with Nutsoglobin?

Use  to shatter them, and you can find a way through.
JOY!
We who are not worthy of the mighty Bowser's personal rescue must honor him...
We, the Magikoopa corps, have attempted to find a suitable way to express our deep gratitude...
And so we hereby present an invigorating and inspiring dance of utter joy and happiness...
No, wait. We talked this over, Jerry, remember? We were gonna sing a song of Bowser praise?
Just a sec. I thought we'd build a monument to his strength!
Fawfulcopters!
Oh, hey, look what happened! Bowser's in Peach's Castle!

No, we were going to make his favorite food, right?
Not me--I voted for polishing his horns with velvet shammies...
We DECIDED this, remember? It was foot massage all the way!
I still think that taking lutes and singing praises is sweet...
Is flossing his teeth still on the table? Because they are NASTY.
No kidding. In fact, we should do a full orthodontic overhaul.
OK, we'll have Alpha Team hit the cavities, then deploy two--

Do you want to practice?

Yes.
Fawful won't lie. Fawful has shock at you getting here.
But that shock turns to chortles as you stop here!
There are doors here that need keys, and Fawful has them!
You will wander forever in my modified castle of Peach until you cry from lack of doors!
You have energy like a little angry battery with no friends.
But even if you get past the doors, the castle of Peach...
Oh, but I have secrecy! Fawful says no more!

Guys, remember what Lord Bowser said earlier?
Well? Do you?!
Yeah! Totally!
...Was it "GWAARGGH?" If not, then I guess I forgot.
Dad will be here any minute. Count on it.
Giddyup!
It's time to party! Who's with me?
Well, he is Bowser's kid. There were bound to be some speed bumps.
JUNIOR STRONG!
BUT...JUNIOR WISE? MORTON NOT KNOW.
Heh. That's insightful, Morton.
Good talk, guys.
Wow...another mature choice!
Choosing to reconnect with his father over partying with blorbed Goombas...
Is it too good to be true?
YO!
...I shouldn't tempt fate.
What are you guys yakking about?!
Let's go!
Of course, they were all wrong.
Bowser Jr. learned to rely on his friends and grew wiser and stronger for it.
PRSHNT...URGHHHH...
Whoa!
Guys, hold on. Something's not right.
I feel it too. This is worse than that Malatone stuff...
It's something more...sinister...
Is it that grinning jerk? Waffle, or whatever?
Whoa! Look at Peach's Castle!
Dad's in there...
Yes, it would seem he has his hands full as well...
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's finish up here so we can go help him out!
Hmph. Still can't get over this new attitude...
He seems genuine to me. What's your concern?
Ehh...
I think I'm just gonna wait for Dad. You guys can deal with the blorbs.
Yes...I see it!
Look at the sky over Peach's Castle. It's...glowing!
Dad?
They're ready!
What do you see?
It's time! Brute Force Minions!
Go forth and lay waste to the Mushroom Kingdom!
I can't see anything, but Dad did that. I know it.
That's the spirit, kid.
If you say so...
Huh. So...can we take credit for what happened, or what?
I mean...we should. But I think he actually figured things out all by himself.
They say that helicopter parenting doesn't work anyway. Just let 'em run wild!
Lord Junior! Come with me!
Sorry, I guess it's not THAT urgent.
I was just thinking we should go distribute the Skeletone and cure the blorbs.
It CAN'T be comfortable to roll around like that.
Oh! I remember why it was so urgent.
I could have explained all of this to them. But...I didn't.
'Cause afterwards, we can party! WOOOO!
Uh, Roy? We're kinda following Junior's lead here, being a little mellow...
Yes, Roy. You see...
WOOOO! Great idea, Roy! Let's shoot off some fireworks!
Oh...
Well, that was short-lived.
OK, Goomba Squad! Soooound off!
Let the kid celebrate. He did show SOME restraint.
Present!
True. Perhaps even more than his father would have.
Present!
Present!
You got the green key!
Remember the enzyme that falls when Bowser's mouth flashes...
That's a bit too much practice eating, no?
Did you hear that?!
Remember where that piece is!
When you eat a piece of carrot that holds that enzyme, it flashes briefly. 
What if we break up these big pieces...
Using that helps Bowser digest really fast, huh?
I wish there were an easier way to break all of them up...
A mouth flash means pay close attention to the swallowed bit.
Keep tapping to break up those big pieces!
For inside that piece hides the digestive enzyme.
Huh?!
This is what tiny super-digestive enzymes look like.
You remember where that piece is? Break it up!
Yes, yes, yes. Practice is over...
If you delete random pieces, the enzyme fades to blue and grows ever weaker.
Go, face-stuff challenge!
It's red right now! It can digest all the pieces at once!
This giga-carrot includes a super-digestive enzyme that quickly digests food.
Found it!
Tapping all those pieces Bowser ate sure isn't easy...
Find that enzyme inside one of those pieces, and activate it right away!
When Bowser's mouth flashes, some enzyme thingy goes active inside one of the pieces!
I wonder if this will make Bowser be able to eat a ton.
Let's tap and see!
Ah, these tiny enzymes hide within other pieces as well...
Ah.
Use it while it is red, and all eaten food will be digested at once.
Ready?
That thing we just heard was a tiny enzyme!
--Secret Note-- order is ■ ● ▲ then door

It might be some kind of hint.
Let's remember it, just in case. I'll make sure not to forget.

What am I, a taxi? Want a coffee too? Maybe a massage?
Look, my castle's in danger!
We gotta head there right now! That weirdo can't have it!
...OK, I understand. Do as you must.
Nothing we can do right now... but Bowser's in bad shape.

Hey! Hold up! Quit hovering!

Wait, I know you!
You're the weirdo who tricked me into eating that mushroom!
I HAVE CHORTLES!
You are the one who is correct! Wasn't it full of delicious?!
Such a special treat called a Vacuum Shroom!
I, Fawful, invented it to make you inhale everything you see!
And I, Fawful, am betting that you are remembering nothing.
You inhaled like a hungry syrup pig at the free pancake buffet.
And then you had the napping. And then I put you in the cave!
WHAAAAT?!
What's your problem, pal? What's your beef with me?
Hey! HEY! COME BACK! I'm not done with you!

The hungry soul needs globin...
The hungry Chombone needs more, and so out it leaps upon that which it craves.
O wildly ravenous Chombone! How can a globin coax you out? By pushing that which floats!

Morton is the last remaining Koopaling...
It may be the time for me to show them what I can do as a first officer...
You can now use Kamek as a First Officer!
By adding a First Officer to your formation, you'll also get the benefit of a First Officer Skill, and some of your troopers may benefit from Bonus Skills.
Remember to use your First Officer Commands in battle to tilt the battle in your favor!
So...that's the Ever Ice, right?
I definitely want to eat it!
Uh...OK.
Um, please don't, though.
Does he not even remember what we're doing here?
Whoa, where'd those ugly things come from?
Oh, what now?
Promise me you will help the minions.
Uh, Kamek?
That's what I'm doing right now. Try to keep up.
No, young Master...right now you are questing for glory. But the minions are surely suffering.
I know you seek your father's approval...
But he would approve of saving the minions!
Please, promise me you'll help them.
It sounds boring...
You must promise me!
OK! Fine! Whatever!
Lighten up, man!
You got Ever Ice!
You have all the ingredients for Skeletone Formula:D!
OK, so...what do I do now?
Do I just crunch it up with my teeth, or did Dad finally get a shaved ice machine?
No, no. I have an idea!
Just tell me how to make the Skeletone! Or I'm gonna eat this delicious looking ice!
I don't know how to make it.
But I have a friend in Blubble Lake who may.
Let's bring the ingredients to her.
Ugh, fine.
Young Master, before we go... I need you to make me a promise.
HYAH!
Hmph. I scoff. I scoff at you. You bluff.
Learn to speak already! And then bring it on, chump!
GOOOOOH!
HOOORGH!
Hmph!
Like that, chump?
But...
NOOOOOOOORGH!
My castle...
MUH MUH MUH!
Bowser! Next time goes a different way than this way went.
It is time. The special weapon of Lord Fawful. I will release it.
SUPER ULTRA WONDER ULTIMATE RUTHLESS GREAT IRON BALL!

Bounce Bowser up by springing yourselves in various directions!
He might bounce high if you two pull waaay back!
That went great!
Yeah, he did!
Didn't Bowser just jump a little bit?
Bowser bounced in the direction you guys sprung...
Then release to make yourselves spring and Bowser bounce!
Like way down here!
Skip minigame and proceed with story? 
No 
Yes
Hey!
When you two spring up, the recoil bounces Bowser!
Pull yourselves back with the stylus...
I get it now... If we stimulate Bowser's body like just now...
He appears to manifest some sort of extreme strength...
Something's happening to Bowser's arm!
A weird statue on the beach... Might be the Sea Pipe Statue.
Look! That area over there...
Something happened in his body! Let's go and check it out!
Taking the kingdom by storm! Squid Fit!
Ride the balance raft and punch the coastal walls! Flex your abs as you twist your hips!
The balance raft is all about momentum! If it starts moving, then you're doing it right!
Soon you'll have the shapely hips of a squid! Nice, right? It's Squid Fit!
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
Oh, wow! Are you a friend of the bug from the farm?
Don't talk much, huh? You must've been in the carrot Bowser ate!
Wow, you got huge. I wonder why? And why are you...uh, sidling?
Yikes! It's been eating those white things! They made it big!
Mario, what should we do?
True... If we don't get Bowser moving, we're in trouble.
Sorry, bug. It seems wrong, but we must...uh, exterminate you.
↑Treasure Chamber Not easy to get in here, no! The door's locked up tight!
Unless you're a genius like me, you'll never figure it out! GWAHAHAHAHA!

OK, inhale gently...
Are you ready?
Strong exhale!
Doctor! Code red! The air vents are going haywire!
OK, exhale...
Ah, my breath inspector's exhaust pipe funnels into the ventilation system!
This machine's malfunction blew out the whole air grid!
Anyway, will Luigi have any high-altitude problems? No.
If anything, his exhalation power is way too strong!
Should you two head for Plack Beach? You should.
And should I fix this infernal machine? I probably should.
One more time...
Does this machine measure inhalation and exhalation levels? There can be no doubt it does.
Now then, Mario, step over here.
Do you have incredible lung control? You certainly do.
You should have no trouble staying alert at high altitudes.
Now then, Luigi is next. Step over here, please.
Hmm... Not good...
Yes, OK.
Mario! Luigi! Blast this one together, OK?
Press and hold both buttons, and keep blasting that thing!
His energy sparked!
His energy spiked!
Bowser's moving again!
His energy sparked!
His energy spiked!
Bowser's moving again!
OK, so how do we ford this adrenaline channel, anyway?
OK, yeah, that's adrenaline!
Because it's red adrenaline, Mario, you have to blast it!
Use that beam to blast the adrenaline as it flies at you.
That next one's green, Luigi!
Fire from the left!
When you blast adrenaline, it fills that adrenameter!
When the adrenameter gets completely filled...
Maybe Bowser's energy gets revived by adrenaline!
Mario, hit the red! Luigi, hit the green! Don't mix it up!
If adrenaline hits the boat of revival, you'll lose a heart.
Don't let that adrenaline hit the boat, OK?!
What's THAT?!
I think a single shot won't repel that adrenaline...
Very wellll... If you are so insistent that I give you the cure, we will battle for iiiiit.
A battle with Wisdurrrrrm... The winner will own the Star Cuuuuuure.
Yes? Then we beginnnnn.
Wisdurm battle sequence STAAAAAAAAAAART!
Guh... Bluh...
Gack... Haff...
Heh heh heh heh...
So you have bested me on the field of baaaaattle.
That victory has earned you the right to see me in my true forrrrrrm.
Wellll? Not too bad looking, hmmmm?
Heh heh heh heh...
Now thennnn... I am one of the guardians of the Star Cuuures.
We sages knew the day of the Dark Star awakening would come, and so awaited the heeeeroes...
We have met many times, as you two well rememberrrr...
The day Bowser ate me along with the giga-carrot was the day our fates crosssssed...
Heh heh heh heh...
It is clear we are connected by a fate that is beyond our poor comprehensionnnn...
Please! Your...Sageness!
Please give us the Star Cure so we can stop the Dark Star!
Of coursssssse... Here, take iiiit.
You got one Star Cure!

You want me, a sage, to give you, a nobody, the Star Cuuure?
I don't know about thaaat...
What physical proof do you have that your story is truuuue? Why should I believe youuuu?
This Star Cure was entrusted to the sole care of me, Wisdurm!
Why would I hand it over to men who lack any credibiiiiility?!
Hmmmmmmmmm... You're quite persistennnnt.
This troubles meeeee.
You chase me without flaaagging. You demand the Star Cuuuure...
Rather brazen, methiiiiiiinks...
Tut tut! Lost our temperrrrr? Somewhat childish, nooooo?
And yet amuuusing! Regrettably...
And so my role here comes to an ennnnnd...
Now, please stop following me around. It's creeeeepy...

They sealed the Dark Star deep under the earth in Toad Town...
Long, long ago, a star sleeping deep below the Mushroom Kingdom was dug up...
It was not benevolent. It was a frightful star that hid a great evil...
The Dark Star.
It was said that if an evil entity found the Dark Star, the world would plunge into darkness...
Fearing that, the Star Sprites that watch over us sacrificed much over many years...
That evil-hearted entity would rule the world...
Speaking of my finest work, I did put more effort into the beef costume.
But enough chitchat.

Ooog... Help us, Mr. Mario!
I want to see my son and my sugar pie!
NOOOOOOOOOOO! SO SICK OF THIS BODY!
So hot. So itchy. So hot and itchy!
C'mon, Dr. Toadley! Still with the blorbs?!
You should take care of yourself, Mario.
In this state, I can't jump at ALL.
I could go for some royal shroom tea...
CURED! I'M CURED!
Oh...Luigi!
Luigi, I'm, like, your biggest fan ever.
Meeting you is, like, the best thing ever.
Mario's famous too, though, so...
One of you guys can fix me up, right?
I sure hope you can! Good luck out there!
Listen, Mario, I don't know what's in there, but I get a REALLY bad feeling about it...
I think maybe you should fully restore your HP and BP, just in case, you know?
This Preservation Chamber... I dunno, what exactly are they "preserving" in there?
And speaking of, I saw a bunch of odd notes scattered around the castle underground...
You think maybe those have something to do with this? Yeah! Gotta be!
I am solving this riddle, by gum! In the name of Lord Fawful!
So there was that one note... And that other note said that other thing...
...Ugh! Dang this tiny brain! It went and forgot what was written on that note!
It's open?! You guys opened it?! No way...
Wuh-well... I'm the one who gave you the hint! You owe me HUGE!
It's open?! You guys opened it?! No way...
You solved the riddle faster than I did...
Mario!
This room... There's something here.
How do I know?
Call it Star Sprite sense. Something's just not right...
You remember what was on those secret notes...
■ once more than ●...
order is ■ ● ▲ then door...
● once only...
■ once less than ▲...
...Right?
Preservation Chamber Access restricted to members of the Bowser Secret Society!
The very latest in door security allows entry only when buttons are pushed in a specific order.
Before pushing the door button, members will push other buttons the specified number of times.
Only society members will be notified of the correct order and number of button presses.
A note to all society members... If you think you'll forget the code, leave NO notes around!
Maybe we missed some hints about this room in the castle or something...
Mario, I think we ought to look around more and come back.
Those sure are some giant buttons, huh...
You think the door in back opens up if we press those things?
Maybe...
Maybe those secret notes we've been finding around the castle are the key...
Yes! Those secret notes have something to do with here! I'm positive!
All that means something...
You guys, let's go check out this room, huh?
What's wrong? You forgot what the secret notes said?
Want me to remind you? 
Nah.
Yes, please!
There's something in here, I know it. Let's check it out.
Maybe there are some other secret notes around...
Yeah, I'm thinking we should hunt for more secret notes...
It opened!
Dark... Even with the dark power completed...
The unthinkable happened...
Are you finally ready to stop running and fight?
The dark power slept so long, and now it wakes...
It must be freed...
Still here? Has the dark power not crushed your puny hopes?
Soon this kingdom will vanish along with all who dwell within.
And you, too, will sleep eternally in the dark power's embrace!
Huuh huuh huuh... Haah haah haargh...
I have fallen...
To come so far... So far... To lose...
BEHOLD!
NOOOOOOOO! WHAAAAAAAAT?!
HOW?! WHO?! WHY?!
Intact?!
Hey! It's you idiots! Explain all this NOW!
Bah! I mean, I DID, but...
I don't remember telling you to build a railway directly into my SECRET TREASURE CHAMBER!
TREASON!
Oh yeah! The Star Cure! It must be in this room!
Safe? Where?
Look at this train track!
Next stop...Bowser's Castle...
Now arriving at the always- run-down-falling-apart-dirty- nasty-thanks-to-Bowser Castle!
Yeah... Well, bro...
As you can see, the secret tunnel project you ordered is finally finished, broski!
Yeah, remember, brotown? You helped us drill this tunnel!
Bro!
This secret tunnel got bought out by the Fawful Foundation!
It was a buyout, brodington! Get me? A BUYOUT!
Thanks to the sweet cash infusion, we outsourced the hole drilling to some other bros.
So now we're elite employees of Lord Fawful! The salary's great, brodie! Insane benefits!
King Bowser! Awesome seeing you again, sir!
Yeah, for real!
Besides, uh, didn't you come here looking for a Star Cure?
Your Surliness!
I found Sergeant Guy and Corporal Paraplonk!
That?
Whoa!
NOOOOF!
Who put a train track down here?
King Bowser! Sir!
You'd better not make enemies of those guys!
Trust me, this Fawful Express that Lord Fawful built is SUPER awesome. Wanna ride, brotron?
Although... Come to think of it, bro, it's a pretty pricey ticket. Maybe too posh for you.
Even if you sold this cruddy old castle...you still can't afford it!
Our sweep of the castle indicates it is intact, sir!
WAHAHAHA!
The Star Cure must be...
All aboard Fawful Express!
It must be secured in that safe, sir!
AWESOME! I'm so awesome!
So, uh...Chippy! Where am I?!
Peach's Castle! Whoa! How'd I end up here?!
You don't need to tell me that!
I owe that Fawful big-time! I'll get Peach back!

For I alone soothe the soul and heal the weary globin.
Shall I heal yours? 
No thanks.
Heal me!
Until next globin...
HP and BP fully restored!
A wise decision indeed. Stand...right...there-ish.
So you don't want to be healed... What a globin.
For example... Someone with zee strength to move islands...
Someone with zee appétit to eat something bigger than he...
Hee... Does zis masseur exist? Heehee... I am so silly...

Something about a cure of some kind... Zis is what I hear, oui...
So zat was zat with Monsieur Kuzzle... I wonder how he is...
Zis man, he loved the sea like life itself, so... Perhaps he has retired near zee beach, oui?
Cherís... Tell me, do you believe in zee aliens?
Once upon a long, long ago... Zey say zat aliens visited zis very kingdom...
Someone told me zis, oui... Zis was long before I arrived in zee area, of course...
Zey were evil... Zey destroyed zee houses, kidnapped people... Zis was a terrible, awful time.
But in zee end... Two champions, superstars in zee green and red, defeated zem all...
And yet... Zere is a rumor zat, in fact, zee aliens are preserved somewhere in zee kingdom...
Heehee... Preserving evil aliens... Zere are some people who have zee bizarre hobbies, honh?
Oh... Now zat I think on it, you two are red and green...
Heehee... Are you perhaps fans of zese famous superstars? Hee... You look a lot like zem...

Heehee... I must apologize... Zis is a personal question, oui...
Ah, if you do have zis person... You must cling to zem tightly, you understand zis?
You do not relax when zey are beside you... For one day, zey may disappear on zee wind...
And...in zee moment you realize zey are gone...you realize how important zey really were...
Zis thing happened to moi... Zat is why, cherís, I tell you to cling to zee special someones...
Zee special someone for moi... Heehee... I wonder if he is still collecting zee silly blocks...
Oh!

Ah... Zis is a tragedy... Heehee... Returnez soon...
The Goombas?
Huh. Interesting.
Allô...
Ready for massage duty?
Hee...
Great! Broque...whatever! Let's review the terms.
My boys will launch an attack on your stiff back, right?
Wait...but it must be you!
How can you 'ave forgotten so soon?
Or maybe I am seeing things. Zere can be a small spiny one and a grown spiny one, no?
Alors, do not mind me.
Honh? Mon cherí...

YAAAARGH!
Whoa, what did I eat?!
That's some serious pain going on down there!
What the-- HEY! Is somebody there?!
Who is that?! Where am I?!
You gotta be kidding! It's in my BODY?!
HEY YOU! IN THERE! WHAT ARE YOU?!
WHY ARE YOU IN MY BODY?!
Peach's Castle?
Mario pounded me at Peach's...
I got chucked into a forest...
I don't remember the rest...
Wait--I ate a weird mushroom from some weirdo in the forest.
Weird forest mushrooms... From some weirdo...
I DON'T GET IT!
I don't get what happened to me at ALL! This is stupid!
And you, partying in my body like you own it. How dare you?!
Whoa, hold it! Long? I hate boring stories...
Hey, wait! You! You in my bod! I've heard your voice before...
Oh yeah, right! Where am I?
Kind of a dim, dank cave.
What in the world am I doing in a dim, dank cave?!
Hrmph! I was gonna do that anyway, genius!
What? My current body shape? You mean, like, at the moment?
Why don't you just...
LOOOOOOOK AT ME!
I'm immobile, genius! Even if I wanna do evil, I can't move!
You think I'm gonna strut out in front of Peach and the rest of them like this?! PLEASE!
Especially Mario! I'm not letting that dude see me this out of shape! That'd be insane!
...Although actually, the extra poundage might just pancake the little guy into dust...
BWHAHAHAHAHAHA! Not a bad evil plan, if I do say so myself!
...Oh, scared silent by me?
Me, who shuns all imitation. Me, the one true globin.
Now pull yourself together and answer questions for me!
Well, grab hold of your globin, and answer questions for me!
Come in... Hello? Bowser? Do you globin me?
NNNGRRRFF!
Heff heff haah...
Some king I am...
Hey! What's that?
I'm all tickly! Feels weird...
I HAVE CHORTLES!
That voice... Fawful!
A bad day for globin...
Your pockets are sad and cash rules inside Bowser.
Lament the fact that your Bowser questions ended!
YOU SHUT YOUR FACE!
What're you doing down there?
Plan?!
Huh? You wanna hear about Bowser's Castle? Gee, it's only the best castle ever made!
Take a look from a distance! Powerful and awe-inspiring design choices slap your face!
It's like looking at me!
And I didn't even mention the best part! Underneath it, there's a chamber full of treasure!
The treasure I took by force sleeps in a pile down there like a giant, golden baby!
But... My awesome castle... That stupid Fawful! The guy remodeled the whole thing!
He turned my military training facility into the Fawful Theater! That's wrong in so many ways!
No, Fawful! Not on my watch! When I get out of here, I'm making it the Bowser Theater!
Whuh? Whazzat? Who's talking?
What?! The princess?!
I inhaled her too?!
I think I'm going nuts... WHAT IS GOING ON?!
Stuck in my own floor...
Looks like Fawful tricked you easy as you please!
Struggling like a baby...
Heehee! It's all in your head! Please, we insist, eat more!
Heehee! You're imagining things! You must keep eating, please!
Huurk! Did I just... put on a few pounds?
Yeah, you are! Heehee!
Hey! Look at me! This isn't normal!
It only makes sense! You eat so many of Lord Fawful's special high-calorie, high-fat dishes...
Of course you'll gain weight!
Pretty impressive fat, though!
Yeah, you're a king of chub!
Yes, yes. I hear you.
Ahahahahahahaha!
Sounds to me like you should go on a diet!
Hmmmm... What to do... What to do...
I guess I'll do something when I feel like it!
YELLO GOOD-BYE!
Well, his sudden weight gain must have produced some changes in his body...
Sounds like a perfect time to look for Princess Peach!
It's me! You know me! Inside your body.
"Me"? Inside my body? You mean Chippy?
No, ME! Don't you know me? I'm the only me there is!
Oh, that's real helpful! "Me" could mean anything!
Oh, for the love of globin...
You have forgotten poor me. Your ingratitude wounds me.
Me, the one who molded you... Sniff... Forgot me...
ENOUGH! WHO ARE YOU?!
What? You wanna know how my body's doing?
Well... I guess normal.
No big complaints, anyway. I guess my throat's kinda dry...
And actually, now that you mention it, my head feels fuzzy.
Yeah... Great, now you got me paranoid, and other places are feeling kinda weird!
There goes my stomach! It's all gurgly and hot! And I know exactly why!
I mean, I ate a ton here, but before that, I ate this huge giga-carrot. That's what did it!
Look, I don't wanna talk about it anymore, OK?
If I keep thinking about this, my whole body will shut down!
............
Are you insane?!
You mean she is INSIDE MY BODY?!
Heehee!
GWAAAAACK!
OWOWOWOWOW!
Huh? You wanna know how I'm gonna KO that idiot, Fawful?
GAHAHAHA! Oh, I've got a few solid ideas, that's for sure!
My current plan is to get up on the Fawful Theater stage again, but this time, I battle Fawful!
And he'll throw stuff at me, but I'll give a manly laugh and inhale everything to finish him off!
Maybe he'll try to escape on his flying thingie, but no dice!
I'll summon my Paratroopa squadron, and they'll blast him out of the sky as he flees!
That reminds me, the guy does use a lot of weird machines...
But I'll just use my Bob-ombs, and BOOM! Oops! All blowed up!
GAHAHAHAHAHA! But first... I do have to escape from here. That's a problem.
Open wiiiiide... Say aaaaah!
Here, have more... C'mon, open up!
Stop! You with the ham! No more! I can't take it!
There's no denying it now...!
I'm nowhere near as svelte as I used to be! I'm chubby!
Hey! You jerks!
You knew all along I'd get like this, and you kept cramming me with food!
NNNNGRAAAH!
It's ME! MEEEEEEEEEEEE!
MEMEMEMEMEMEMEMEME MEMEMEMEMEMEMEMEME!
What? You're asking how I feel about this Chippy in my body?
Well, I'm not a fan, I gotta say. She's always yapping about whatever, which I don't need.
She comes off kinda superior, too, which ticks me off!
But beyond all that, I don't even know what she is! I mean, how long's she been in there?!
I wanna know where she is, just once. That's all.
But hey, she's in there fixing up all the nasty parts in my bod, so I can't complain, right?
Yeah, I'll have her work for a few more shifts, you know? GWAHAHAHAHAHA!
Huh-hey! Chippy! Can you hear me?
ME.
Sh-shut up!
What will you ask Bowser about? （5 coins per question.） 
His body condition. 
Bowser's Castle. 
Quit asking questions.
And after you shut up, turn me back to my usual trim self!
What will you ask Bowser about? （5 coins per question.） 
His body condition. 
Bowser's Castle. 
Fawful's cooking. 
Chippy. 
Quit asking questions.
I fell into the FLOOR, genius! I'm stuck! YOU do something!
Burn off all this blubber!
What will you ask Bowser about? （5 coins per question.） 
His current body shape. 
How he'll KO Fawful. 
Chippy. 
Next page of questions. 
Quit asking questions.
Hey! I'm serious! Do something!
What will you ask Bowser about? （5 coins per question.） 
His body condition. 
Bowser's Castle. 
Fawful's cooking. 
Last page of questions. 
Quit asking questions.
What? Fawful's cooking?
Guy can't cook! It was nasty! I spat it out, it was so gross!
...Well, I wanna say that, but actually, the dude's a prodigy. The flavors were unbelievable!
You know what I liked the best? General Fawful's Spicy Chicken!
I mean, it was spicy, but INSIDE the spice was delicacy and body and, man, I could eat it forever!
And the flavors in his cake... THEY BLEW MY MIND!
I'm talking about rich cream and fluffy sponge exploding in your mouth like a taste volcano!
Believe me, I was shocked a guy that weird had such skills!
Haah... Haah... Haah...
↑Toad Town ↓Plack Beach
Ah... GAHAHAHA!
Uh, yeah. That's right! Grand entrance, huh?
I go the extra mile for you guys! Remember that!
DID YOU SEE THAT?!
That was HUGE!
FREEDOM!
You really know how to make an entrance, sir!
Ramming through those rocks with a ship?! GENIUS!
No doubt! It would've been boring if you just punched it!
That's our king!
KING BOWSER!
SO RAAAAD!
The Koopas joined as minions! You can now use Koopa Corps in battle!
Do you want to practice? 
No.
Yes.
KING BOWSER!
Dude! Isn't that Mario?!
Why is HE here?
This isn't the zoo! Go away!
Ooh, you guys are so gonna get it from King Bowser later!
Yeah! Yeah!
King Bowser's amazing!
Just a little while ago he moved a ship THIS big!
That's true!
He broke a wall for us!
Yeah! For us!
Bowser's real nice!

But...
Then he didn't open this cage...
Not cool...
So not cool...
Go away...
Could this...possibly be... the shattered memory of the safe combination?!
Affirmative. Correct. There was large-scale trauma.
This memory was broken. Affirmative. Correct.
It must have been when the Fawful Express rammed him...
No wonder he can't remember that combination... So how do we get it back?
Stylus. Affirmative. Correct. Touch pieces with the stylus.
While touching the pieces, move them over the panel.
If the pieces stick and do not move, you have located the correct place.
The button at the bottom of the panel is the rotator. It will rotate a piece when touched.
Pieces must face the proper direction. Affirmative. Correct.
This method will allow for memory reorganization.
Do you understand? 
No.
Yes.
Mario! Luigi!
The button at the bottom of the panel is the rotator. It will rotate a piece when touched.
Pieces must face the proper direction. Affirmative. Correct.
Fix that broken memory as fast as you can!
You did it! Incredible! 9898  88241  983 That's the safe combination!
Move pieces with the stylus. Rotate pieces with the rotator.
Who, me? I just told you! I'm Kuzzle. Did I say that?
My ears aren't s'good.
You can't tell by lookin', I bet, but I used to be called a sage.
Who's on the puzzle what? Oh, you came for a puzzle! Boy, I am fond of the puzzles.
Young folks today, they can't be bothered to use their heads, but when I was a tot...
Puzzles were the hippest of the hip! You'd try to solve a puzzle faster'n anyone, you would!
Speakin' of trendy tots...

Speakin' of trendy tots...
What? I what? What was it?
Right, I was talkin' puzzle. Wonder if you guys can do it...
Y'see, me, I make the puzzles the old-fashioned way...
And them trendy Attack Pieces? I tried puzzlin' 'em up, but...
Thing is, if I make me a puzzle, I can't never seem to finish it.
You want to give 'er a try? 
Do a puzzle. 
Hear about puzzles. 
Don't do a puzzle.
Ready for puzzlin'? 
Do a puzzle. 
Hear about puzzles. 
Don't do a puzzle.
Ready for a little puzzlin'? Or do you want to hear this old coot ramble for a tick or two?
Do a puzzle. 
Hear about puzzles. 
Listen to Kuzzle ramble. 
Bail out.
I just realized somethin'! That thing you tots have!
Either I'm foggy, or that there is a Star Cure!
You aren't wantin' to hear it? That's a shame, tots.
Well, anytime you want to hear it, just swing on by.
Well, I'm a bit older and more shrivelly now, but I used to be a sage, and a popular one, too!
Tots today, they just care about their looks, but not ol' Kuzzle! I didn't give a toot about 'em!
Me, I took pride in usin' the ol' bean to solve me a quiz or a humdinger of a puzzle.
"Wow, excellent job, Kuzzle!" "Absolutely brilliant, Kuzzle!" "You're really hip, Kuzzle!"
Oh, yep, I was hip all right. I can still picture myself as I was then. Hip. Really hip.
This house was a party pad back then. Luxurious decor, catering, bands, the works.
But that were a while ago...
Anyway, just t'other day...
I was enjoyin' me a fine puzzle, as is my custom, when I had me a doozy of a pickle.
I was about to put in the final piece, and at that moment... Yep... At that exact moment...
He arrived...
Oh, you tots know the fella... That big ol' galoot, Bowser... He came in pure angry...
I tried to have him do a puzzle, but within thirty seconds he got way too peeved! He said...
"I DON'T GET IT!"
So he started raisin' him a ruckus and messed up all the furniture in the room.
On top of that, the galoot ran off with the Star Cure, which is a sage's charge.
Oh, it's a tough ol' tale, yep. That big galoot was actin' like a big ol' baby...
And ever since then, well, ain't nothing much has gone on around here.
I mean, if he stormed in here again, there ain't exactly anythin' for him to steal...
And that's the tale, tots. Now this ol' coot would like to enjoy a peaceful puzzle.
Anytime you're lookin' to do the same, you come by and visit old Kuzzle...
Can't wait to have me a nap on that.
Yep, now that there is what I call hip design.
Yep... Hip...
Hm... Gazin' out of this reminds me of the first lady of my life.
Mysterious and strange, just like memory itself, young tots.
You tots are...quittin'?
Tots today have got no drive, I tell you what.
Ready for a little puzzlin'? Or do you want to hear this old coot ramble for a tick or two?
Do a puzzle. 
Hear about puzzles. 
Listen to Kuzzle ramble. 
Hear about puzzle sacks. 
Bail out.
Oh, got yourself a puzzle, eh? How's about I hang onto that.
You tots feel the urge to jump into that puzzle right away?
You can also retry ones you already solved, of course.
It's a challenge, tryin' to solve them puzzles quick as you can.
Me, in my heyday, I'd always get a perfect score of 100.
You got one of every type of bean!
Yep, a sofa-bed puzzle. Get to solvin' it posthaste...
OOOOOH!
Yep, a table puzzle. Get to solvin' it posthaste...
YOU DID IT!
Yep, a carpet puzzle. Get to solvin' it posthaste...
You tots...solved each of the puzzles in under two minutes!
What planet are you from?! I am utterly astounded, tots.
I admit, I was messin' with you a bit before, but now you get...
100 points!
...How'd you tots like to move in and become puzzle disciples?
Yep, a mystery-window puzzle. Get to solvin' it posthaste...
I mean... You tots are unreal.
Yep, an Attack Piece puzzle. Lookin' for a timed challenge? I'll go ahead and keep score.
Y'know what? I just now thought of nicknames for you tots!
Yep... You ready for it?
Super Puzzle Bros.
How about it? Hip, right? Super Puzzle Bros. Yep.
I'm thinkin' the ladies will be all over you tots with that name.
Puzzle Bros. is way hipper than Puzzle Guys or some such.
Y'know what? I'm gonna throw an "ultra" on there as well.
Ultra Super Puzzle Bros. Maybe too long... Enough.
Yep, a sofa-bed puzzle. Lookin' for a timed challenge? Goin' fast makes you popular.
You tots are takin' a bit too long with the puzzlin'.
Yep. Sorry to say, that's just a -point performance.
Hm? You think I'm just pullin' that score out of nowheres?
Years of experience and intuition form that score, tots.
And that intuition tells me the ladies would find you unhip.
Yep, a table puzzle. Lookin' for a timed challenge? Let's see how quick you are.
Yep, a carpet puzzle. Lookin' for a timed challenge? Puzzles are the new fad, yep.
Well now, if it ain't the Super Puzzle Bros.!
Ready for a little puzzlin'? Or do you want to hear this old coot ramble for a tick or two?
Do a puzzle. 
Hear about puzzles. 
Listen to Kuzzle ramble. 
Bail out.
That's some puzzlin' skill. Here. Beans up stats like HP, BP, and POW.
Fill out the decor in my place, and I'll get you tots more.
You got 10 Plack Beach Attack Pieces at once!
All Attack Pieces found!
You got a new Bros. Attack!
Ooooh...
You did it! She's done!
Heh heh heh... Yep, my puzzles turn real when completed...
Ain't that a wonder?
I told you, I'm a mite shrivelly now, but I was once a sage.
Well... I guess you tots need them Attack Pieces more'n me.
For me, just seein' that there puzzle done is reward enough.
Well, I'm sure you young tots are busy and all, but gosh...
Any chance...you want to hang around with this old coot?
Thing is, I ain't got nothin' here but an empty old house...
Yep, just a bit ago, there was what you call an "incident."
Since then, I try to keep the place pretty empty, y'see...
Yep, a mystery-window puzzle. Lookin' for a timed challenge? This one gives me the willies.
But the urge to splurge is strong in me, tots!
Get me a little plush furniture, y'know?
That one's still missin'. Can't try missin' puzzles.
Problem is, all my furniture turned into puzzle pieces and scattered on the beach.
The thing about 'em is... They're not sealed away, exactly, but they are hidden...
Yep, an Attack Piece puzzle. Best time: min.,  sec. 
Yep, all over Plack Beach... Lots of them puzzle sacks...
Complete them puzzles, tots, and this house'll be a wonder!
How 'bout it? Don't sound so difficult, now, do it?
I got a reward, 'course.
Sure! I'll fork over some of these beans I got here.
You know 'em? They're precious! Beans up yer stats, you know.
But I'm gettin' ahead of things. You go get them puzzle sacks.
Don't you tots worry... I'll wait just as long as I have to.
Yep, a sofa-bed puzzle. Best time: min.,  sec. 
Oh... You want to know where them sacks are?
I only know the general areas, to tell the truth...
Yep, a table puzzle. Best time: min.,  sec. 
You tots go look for 'em...
If you need to hear them locations again, just ask.
Well, your move, tots...
Yep, a carpet puzzle. Best time: min.,  sec. 
Yep, a mystery-window puzzle. Best time: min.,  sec. 
Ah, yep! That's pleasant! Awful pleasant, tots!
All them old memories come floodin' back!
You two are good folk for indulgin' the request of...
This old coot...
You deserve a fine reward. Yep, I'm talkin' beans.
By now you know beans up your HP, BP, and whatnot.
You got five of every type of bean!
Anytime you feel like puzzlin', you tots just come on over.
Challenge yourself to some timed puzzle runs, y'know?
You can chase down my perfect 100-point score.
 minutes,  seconds!
 minutes,  seconds...
What, now? It sounded like a "no." That's too bad...
I've got to say, tots, that was pretty quick puzzlin'!
Now... I'm thinkin' that's a -point performance.
Hm? You think I'm just pullin' that score out of nowheres?
Years of experience and intuition form that score, tots.
And that intuition tells me you tots are pretty darn hip.
Ready for puzzlin'? 
Do a puzzle. 
Hear about puzzles. 
Hear about puzzle sacks. 
Don't do a puzzle.
Mmmm...
Let 'er rip.
Hmm... You're just not there yet. Nope, not enough speed.
Yep, I'm afraid that was just a -point performance.
Hm? You think I'm just pullin' that score out of nowheres?
Years of experience and intuition form that score, tots.
And that intuition tells me you tots are just barely hip.
Hey, kiddo. Here's a li'l something extra.
You got Barrier Wear!
...............
You're what? Oh. Me. I'm Kuzzle.
You look a little pale, buddy.
You gonna chug that thing?
Gotta say, that green thing looks unchuggable.
That gross green thing you're chugging... I saw a red one.
I'm sure some other Sockop went ahead and chugged it.
You know the block above the bramble patch? MINE.
I love chugging on those things. Seriously, too good.
All blocks are good, but ones with Attack Pieces are GREAT!
I'm whatcha call a discriminating chugger. I only chug the best.
When's the boss coming back?
I mean, you...kinda look like the boss, don't you...
So hungry...
That shabby green thing... I so want to chug that...
～ VIP ROOM ～ Your silence is appreciated.
Sneaking leftovers will be dealt with severely.
Hey! Mario! Hurry! Hurry!
It's a meeting! Big meeting! You've gotta hurry, please!
Everyone's waiting, Mario! In the conference hall!
...Oh. Luigi came too. Super.
Look, the conference hall is in back. Please hurry!
NO! WAIT!
You'll chub out again!
Mmm, still some food left.
It's about snack time... Better snarf something.
So?!
Some things only globin knows... Like when one sees nothing...
One must let light shine on to make the invisible-ish exist!
Or the opposite. Some things shun the light and hide when light strikes their globin.
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
Mario! Oh, man, and Luigi too! Where have you guys BEEN?!
You two disappeared, and Peach and Toadsworth too...
It was like, all of a sudden, Peach's Castle was just empty!
Huh? Fawful? Dunno about him...
Anyway, castle entry is prohibited now.
But you're allowed in, right? I mean, right?
You oughta try!
Toad Town's under construction, but the castle path is open.
You know where it is, right? Take that bridge to the north.
I'm pretty sure the castle is deserted, but...
You noticed the Toad Town revitalization project, right?
Yeah, we're building a huge shopping mall! Ah, progress!
You'll be able to pass through any day now, so be patient!
In Peach's Castle! Just a little while ago! Oh, man! I swear I heard a voice...
There shouldn't be anyone in there at all... Could it be a ghost, you think?
This road is going to connect to the new Toad Town shopping mall.
We'll get it done soon, but for now, be patient, OK?
Oh, Mario... Listen, I... I have some choice info.
Mario... Can you tunnel underground?
Y'know, deep into the dirt? Aw, you can't, huh...
When you can tunnel into dirt, come see me.
THE MALL IS OPEN!
Construction's done!
Up ahead connects to Toad Town's fancy new shopping mall.

です。
Construction's finally done!
Toad Town's residential quarter is straight ahead.
Head south from the residences to find the new shopping mall!
An entry was added to the Guide.
Mario... Is it possible you can now tunnel underground?
Great. Great. I've got some choice info for you, then.
Tunnel down into that spot and try jumping!
Yeah, we call that a bean. They hide under those spots.
You guys can use them to make your stats stronger!
It seems slow, gaining 1 point at a time, but if you use lots...
Before you know it, your battles will be easy as pie!
There are bean spots all over the Mushroom Kingdom...
And you can find them just by looking at the mini map.
Just look for the bean spot icon to get the right map.
Oh, and you can see your bean count in the Items menu!
Find all you can. They're a secret to everybody!
Mario, you're making sure to watch your health, right?
Keeping limber with all those crazy jumps and whatnot, huh?
So have you been to the new shopping mall that just went up?
I heard there's some kind of high-end luxury shop there, but...
I guess it's snobby. Only high ranks get in...
Good thing there are so many monsters around, I guess. Easy to level up!
Nothing happened...
Return here once you find something...
This shape doesn't fit...
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
Uh...
Yeah... Well... Sort of...
Right, well, I'll keep poking around to see what I can find.
Bob-ombs...
AWAAAAAY!
Yuh... You guys! Good luck!
Mario!
You guys found your way here too, by boogity!
So I've been investigating this area, and I discovered that this region controls the body slam!
Body slam?
Yes, by boogity! Body slam!
If my calculations are correct, the body slam somehow doubles Bowser's weight while airborne.
With that doubled weight, Bowser can slam into the ground with incredible force!
You see these three pressure points? If you stimulate them, you'll awaken the body slam...
But right now the pressure points aren't active...
Stimulating them right now wouldn't have any effect.
Something somewhere in this area must activate those pressure points, by boogity!
Mario! Luigi! See if you can find something!
Ummmmm... Hitting it doesn't seem to work...
Instead of hitting it, try turning it maybe?
Mario!
Looks like something's happened to Bowser.
Tougher than he looks.
Aw, but we already got that first Star Cure...
Body slam, by boogity!
I guarantee you he can do body slams now!
That went well, by boogity!
Where are you going? There's nothing that way!
The pressure points are active! Well done, by boogity!
All right! Try stimulating those three pressure points, and we'll see what happens!
HRRRRGH!
YOWWWWCH! HOT! WHOA, HOT!
GAHAHAHA!
Looks like red-hot Bowser is still alive and well!
I HAVE CHORTLES!
Are you liking them? The giant Fire Piranha Plants Fawful has raised?
They are enjoying the barbecue of whatever goes near their mouths!
Do they give you the angry face? Then just fly up and hit them with spikiness!
Oh, but I have sadness! Tears of laughing for poor Bowser, who does not fly!

Not long ago, in a castle soon to be airborne...
Oh, breakfast boy is having the cravings again! He is simple like butter sandwich.
Lord Fawful...the plan is in motion.
Leave the capturing of Bowser to us!
Your wish is our command, Lord Fawful.
Yes! Fawful's wishes are the gold coins in your tattered thrift-store pants!
You must never be forgetting about them!
...Understood.
Leave it to the Best Fitness Friends!
I'm not done yet!
One more time!
Lord Bowser!
Oh, yeah? I'll show you!
Bring it on!
Although it had already survived being commandeered, launched into the air multiple times, punched, lit on fire, and nearly destroyed...
Bowser's Castle would never be the same...
Oh no!
The cannon seems to be jammed. Gadzooks! It's filled with Goombas!
OWWW!
Nooooooo! The Goombas knocked over the Whomps like dominoes. Oh, the Goomanity!
Ahhh! We're gonna get crushed!
Great news I am hearing! And you will join me in the completion of this plan to its utmost completing!
Now where are the loud and muscle-having ones?
Dieter! Beef! Kaley!
Come and share in the chortles with Fawful!
Hey, you're not bad!
Prove it!
Bowser joined your squad!
Wait...how is the castle just...gone?!
Like...where is it?
Hey! Kamek! Where's the castle? Dad's not gonna like this!
I expect not... I suppose we had better go find it...
Because I am a coolish sort of Emoglobin, I will tell you to where these pipes connect.
Care to hear my globin? 
I'm fine.
Yes, tell me.
That bluish pipe goes to the blue waters of Blubble Lake.
The bluish pipe below goes to a DIFFERENT part of Blubble Lake, so be careful.
Really? Go outside?
If Bowser's body stops reacting, it'll probably be OK then...
For now, we should check out the area that's reacting!
The greenish pipe goes to the green trees of Dimble Wood.
And the blackish pipe goes to the castle of our Bowser-ish host, Bowser's Castle!
O fancy pinkish pipe, you go to pretty Peach's Castle.
My globins tell me Fawful lives there now, so maybe it's not so pretty at the moment.
See that Emoglobin down below? Ask that one about the more lower-ish pipes.
The purplish pipe goes to Toad Town caves.
Mario! There's a reaction somewhere inside Bowser! Let's go check it out!
WAIT! Where are you going?!
Get after that bug right now!
O fancy pinkish pipe, you go to pretty Peach's Castle.
Mario! By boogity!
That last shock opened up deeper byways in Bowser's body!
Check this out!
WAIT!
All the pipes Bowser inhaled piled up in this room!
You're the first sage, right? We need to talk to you!
Because I am a nice-ish sort of Emoglobin, I will tell you to where these pipes connect.
Care to hear my globin? 
I'm fine.
Yes, tell me.
That's right!
Mario! Luigi! Get it together!
The yellowish and purplish pipes go to Toad Town.
Purplish takes you to the caves. Yellowish leads to the shopping mall to browse for globin.
These pipes should take us to the Mushroom Kingdom.
If we use these, we can get out, by boogity!
Follow that bug!
The bluish pipe is connected to Blubble Lake.
Oh, to sunbathe by the lake! I could tan my globin!
Hurry! Get in this pipe!
Bowser's trying to do something.
Let's go check out what's going on.
See that Emoglobin up above? Ask that one about the more upper-ish pipes.
Hurry, by boogity!
Mario! Bowser's trying to do something.
Don't you want to see what's going on?
Mario! Looks like Bowser's trying to do something.
His body's having a reaction...
Really? Go outside?
Once Bowser gets off that machine, I guess it'll probably be OK...
For now, we should check out what's going on in his body.
Mario? What's wrong? You want to go outside?
That's true...
But we can't leave Bowser all bloated like that...
We'd better wait until Bowser gets back to normal.
You again?! You just love this place, huh, blockface?
Oh! Monsieur Turtle Bits... Why is poor moi here, he asks... Well... I have zee troubles.
My petit pet block, he is lost to moi...
ALLOOOOOOO! MON CUTE BROGGY!
COME BACK TO MOI! I AM MISSING YOU!
MON CHERÍ! Petit Broggy! You returnez!
Come to moi, honh? Give us zee petite hug you like so well!
Oh! Crazy Broggy! Why do you do zis?
GWAHAHA!
Man, you are priceless. This thing is your pet?
Oui, although it seems today he is not his usual self, honh?
BROOF!
I can do nothing when he is like zis. Could you teach him zee manners, s'il vous plaît?
Pfft! No prob, buddy! It'll take about one punch!
Oh! I would not say zis thing, non! Très dangerous!
Broggy, he grows angry, oui. And zen he cannot be bested!
Your petit punches, I believe zey will not work!
BROOF BROOF!
Ah! So very cute, even as he runs away from moi!
I am missing him already! Wait! Petit Broggy!
FORGIVEZ MOI!
So your power and that of the Dark Star have combined...
Dark Bowser... That's almost too terrifying to bear...
Talk about a strong enemy... I don't want to tell them...
But...
OK, it's time to teach that fake me a painful lesson!
It's time he learned what REAL power is!
Where... Dark power... Being who drains...
Where... Where...
You! Gimme back Peach!
Wait! I mean it! You let Peach go!
Hey! What's going on up there, huh?!
Is Peach in trouble?!
Chippy! Listen!
This crazy dark smoke dude that looks just like me came out of my mouth!
    
 Wait! What?!
Yeah, and this fake me kidnapped Peach!
Locked up tight, huh...
Figures it wouldn't be easy...
Huh? In the back? Behind the castle?
Oh, right... There's an entry in the rear gardens!
Let's go!
Dark Star! Dark Star! Fawful is wanting you!
Seriously?! You again?!
You're such a huge pain!
It is you who are the pain to me! I am needing more power!
Like that's my problem! I'm done with you, pal!
Where's that fake me?!
Your meddling has made Fawful have a fury large as the world!
Bowser! It is time for meeting and greeting with your doom!
For now it is the end of the final act of the finale's closing last encore!
I am having this castle! And now I am thinking...
It needs Fawfulization! Time for the remodeling!
SUPER PEACH'S CASTLE OF FURY!
OK, so that was NOT a fight I ever expected...
Eh? Kamek? I hope you're listening to me!
Oh. Yes, yes of course. Quite impressive.
But if it pleases you, young Master, what's the last ingredient?
Oh, right. What was it again?
Clever rice?
Never nice?
Oh! Something to do with ice...maybe?
Could it be...Ever Ice?
Yeah, that thing! That's the stuff.
Hey, so...we're a little light on Koopalings lately... Bahaha!
You sure? I mean, I am in the mood for a long solo hike through unfamiliar and dangerous territory...
See you later, I guess. Bahaha!
Whatever, weirdo. I don't care if you ever come back!
Young Master, please! We can't walk as fast as you can fly!
IGGY NOT HURT. IGGY COME HOME...
You can now change Bowser Jr. to a Flying type in the Formation menu!
Select Bowser Jr. and press  to change his type.
Kamek!
Quit your pondering and let's go get that ice stuff!
YOU! YOU ARE ONION?
Yes, of course. We'll go now. To Bowser's Castle!
Yes, this is onion. Me not onion.
Me EAT onion and get energy. Yum, lots.
GIVE MORTON ONION. NOW!
Won't.
MORTON NEED ONION.
Well, that was odd and grammatically tortuous, but at least we have the onion now.
Me need too!
...Well, what are you waiting for, young Master? Get the Omega-onion!
GIVE NOW!
No, won't!
GIVE!
Again with the voice? It's freaking me out! I can smell your voice loud and clear!
And it smells less...blobbly than usual. That's a word, right?
That's the Beef I know. Strong and silent.
Come on! We're wasting time!
It's called Ever Ice!
And it can be found...
Yes, yes, it must be the stuff...
It can be found beneath Bowser's Castle! Safely hidden in the Lava Lair.
Me...rare item. Eat for HP recovery.
I thought the young Master might one day want it again.
So I stored it in a freezer in the castle's basement.
Yes, yes...supposedly it will never melt. Call me cautious.
In any case, what sweet irony!
Initially, I sought the item under orders from Lord Bowser to please the young Master.
And now, young Master seeks the item to gain Lord Bowser's approval.
Young Master? Ehem, I believe it's actually the other thing.
Oh, it almost brings a tear to the eye...
Me, you, battle.
If I no win, I give you onion.
What? Why are you talking like that? What are you even saying?
SMALL BOWSER BATTLE HIM.
SMALL BOWSER NOT LOSE. SMALL BOWSER GET ONION.
Won't give! Won't ever give!
...Will...give.
ONION! YOU GIVE! PROMISE IS PROMISE.
Hey, Morton! What's going on over there?
Oh! Is that the Omega-onion?!
Woohoo! I got it!
If I find the last ingredient and make that supplement thing...
I can turn our Goombas back to normal and Dad will be super proud!
Did you see all that?
I can TOTALLY handle anything by myself!
Whoa!
Look at that!
That's... Isn't that the one Iggy was riding in?
Well, it's mine now!
Young Master! I believe...
Now I'm REALLY worried about him...
What? What do you believe? Talk faster, Kamek!
If you know something about this Whatever Ice, spill it!
IGGY SAFE.
Pardon?
SERIOUSLY?!
IGGY NOT HURT.
How do you know that?
Hey! Slowpokes! I'm leaving!
*sniffle* Yes?
I mean... Yes, young Master?
SILENCE!
This was a one-Junior job to begin with.
I don't need a stinkin' babysitter!
So, you know...
Scram!
WHERE OTHER KOOPALINGS? MORTON WORRY.
Me too, big guy...
Did you hear all that? Dieter! DIETER!
The final ingredient is in the basement of Bowser's Castle!
We will have to be flexible and contort our plans like we contort our fit bodies, but that's no problem.
Now, let's get moving! Back to the castle that is soon to be ours!
Yes! Ooh, I can already taste the sight of the minions guzzling our precious Skeletone...
Or maybe these supplements have confused and intermingled my senses...WHATEVER.
I can't wait until the shocking secret of Skeletone Formula:D is revealed...
Stay tuned, everyone!
Losers.
No!
Beef? Are you talking, or is my crystal clear mind playing tricks on me again?
Won't!
Well, that's a surprise! It's like a second birthday for me, only with less crying.
Now we don't have to waste our time hunting for those ingredients like common pharmacists.
...I'm not talking.
We can just get down to business!
They collect...we steal! It's the sweetest deal!
GIVE TO MORTON!
Won't give!
30 minutes later...
You're both terrible at talking!
Guess I'll just stomp this thing and take the onion.
You still here. Awkward.
...Breath not good, either.
I go home now.
BAHAHA!
You got the Omega-onion! The only ingredient left is Ever Ice!
Darn skippy! Bowser rules!
Of course you will, sir! That's our King Bowser!
↑Toad Town ↓Plack Beach
KING BOWSER!
You guys hear footsteps?
Could it be Bowser?
It's us, sir! Your Koopa Troopa unit!
King Bowser!
Your Awesomeness!
We're getting evacked, guys! Bowser's here for us!
He can't get through that wall, though, can he?
Belay that talk, soldier! Bowser can break anything!
Hey yeah, you're right! That's why he's the king!
Who's that?
Behind this rock wall, huh...
Man! Too hard!
AH... GAHH... GWAHAHA!
Ahh... Of course I'll break it! This wall's going DOWN, baby!
Crud! I've gotta hit this thing with something big, or no dice...
Scratch that--something HUGE... Guess I'd better go looking...
Hmmm... You're a pretty beefy guy, aren't you... Yes, yes... Solid in the midsection...
Hmmmmmmmmmmm... Who'd be stronger, you or the burly Midbus guy...
Hmm, hmm, and more hmm! What an absorbing conundrum!
YOIKS! Oh gosh, you scared me. I'm still freaked. The castle just FWOOSH! Flew into the air!
VROOOOMBLE! It went right up! SHHHHKROOSH! It dipped down! It was so awesome!
But then there was this loud KRRCHUNK! And BOBBITYBOOSH! It fell back down!
That's when I thought to myself, SHLAMMA HAMMA BORT!
Hey there, can I interest you in a genuine, bona fide, Fawful Theater key chain?
Here, check this out... Press this button and...
...It makes that Fawfully sound! Tell all your friends!
You know that little tour-guide Goomba? You know her name? I'm DYING to know!
The way she turns those "s" noises into "th" noises just melts me into fondue!
ARGH! I CAN'T BEAR IT! I just want to put her on my shell and tote her around...
You look like a fine fellow who feels like feasting on a fresh, fudgy Fawful cookie!
Crunchy crispness, chewy chips! It's a full-scale festival of frantic fudgy fabulosity!
So buy, buy, BUY a bunch! ...When I'm not sold out.
Fawful trading cards, Fawful key chains, fudgy Fawful cookies!
Fawful action figures, hot Fawful sausages, Fawful magic beverages!
I gotta buy it ALL, man! Aaaah! It's all too much!
Order please, s'il vous plaît!

Don't buy anything.

Don't listen.
Listen.
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
Ah! Monsieur Turtle Bits! Zis block called to you, honh?

Oui, with zis magnifique block, you can enjoy zee pleasures of shopping while traveling!

Refresh me!
NEGATIVE IONS GOOOOOOOO!
Sorry, monsieur... Zee coins, you lack zem...
HP and BP fully refreshed!
Some call me an Emoglobin with save-ish qualities.
I have save-ish qualities, but also disappear-soon-ish ones.
Want to save your globin? 
No.
Yes.
The latest kingdom fad! It's Seesaw Fit! Bowser's Castle debut!
Jump as high as you can and slam down on the seesaw!
Ride it, and when the seesaw peaks, jump and slam again!
Slam your past regrets! Slam your worst memories! Slam and slam some more!
Both stress and unwanted fat will slam away!
てんめつするよ！！
Yボタンをおすと とじるよ
Move like this...
If you make yourselves slide with the stylus, you'll repel the pollen.
Use the pollen to change all the nasal walls' colors!
Mario! Careful! Don't hit the spiky pollen!
That's why Bowser's nose was itching!
Then you'll move on the path the stylus slid!
Whoa!
Be careful not to lose all your hearts!
When the pollen hits the walls, they change color!
Next, you guys should slam into the swollen membrane! Do it!
Oh, that's pollen raining down...
And bounce all the pollen into the walls!
Like, say you trace this path for you two...
You think we'll affect his body if we knock that pollen into his nasal walls?
If you hit a spiky pollen, you lose one heart...
Skip minigame and proceed with story? 
No 
Yes
Wow, that's quite a serious reaction...
This is a different kind of pollen!
Dude... What?!
He's too strong!
Get the gang in the castle!
HURRY!
Here goes!
OH YEAH!
HOLD FAST!
YOU'RE GOING DOWN!
THINK YOU CAN TAKE ME?!

Oh man, nice statue! Talk about tacky!
SMASH TIME!
Hmm... Wait...
Right below here...
OH NO!
Oh, not good! Fawful's statue!
HRRRRRGH!
Midbus and Fawful aren't here, man!
We're the only ones who can stop this!
Everyone push at once! We can do this!
AAARGH!
Open your eyes, minions!
CAN'T LOSE! 
Hey! He's back!
He just won't quit! Let's go, guys!
You found a puzzle sack! Take it to Kuzzle!
Hmm... Only  of them...
That is not promise enough to keep the peace in the wood.
There are ten total, so I must ask you to find more than half.
 left! Keep it up.
That is not promise enough to keep the peace in the wood.
There are ten total, so I must ask you to find more than half.
 left! Keep it up.
PROMISE?!
OK then.
First you will take responsibility and collect some Attack Pieces.
There are ten total, so I must ask you to find more than half.
When you get 6 pieces, then I will cancel the high alert.
Did you go recover some Attack Pieces?
Hmm... Only  of them...
Ah. You got 6 pieces, huh. That is taking responsibility.
State of alert lifted.
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
You have more responsibility. Find the Attack Pieces ahead.
Find all that hide in the woods ahead to create an attack that can shake the very ground.
But I smell danger up ahead. You must collect them quickly.
Did you find the Attack Pieces that you sought?
An attack that makes the ground shake is very dangerous indeed.
I must request that you use it elsewhere... Not in this wood.
That's what you want to hear? Then POW! Take that, monsters!
...Right?
OK, no.
This forest has been beset by many incidents of late.
Crop ransacking, castle overthrowing, giant monsters...
So we're going on high alert. No access through here.
Attack Pieces? You're hunting...
These blocks?
Containing these things?
OK! Here you go!
I KNEW it! Oh, I just KNEW it! You two are nasty hooligans!
You plan on rampaging through this peaceful forest, don't you?
Look, I simply will not tolerate any more trashing of this wood.
Will you promise not to go rampaging through the forest?
←Path to Aboveground →Bowser's Castle Shortcut
There!
Mario! Luigi! There it is!
Hmm... Looks like it tried to absorb Bowser's genetic information...but didn't get it all.
Only Bowser's body could give even the Dark Star indigestion!
Yeah! Now's the time!
Figure out some way to KO that Dark Star!
Even if it's weak, I wouldn't get any closer to the Dark Star.
There must be a way to damage it from a distance...
MWAHAHA! 
Aha!
Lord Midbus! The castle approaches Dimble Wood. Bowser is not far!
It was a stroke of genius to commandeer the castle, if I do say so myself, sir...
Bowser always made us walk everywhere.
This is our chance!
Bad to the bone, maybe.
Steady as she goes.
Those guys are just sitting around. They must be hurt!
I...I think I we can take 'em!
Tsk.
All right, get ready to take a picture.
Um...
But, Master...
No one knows what causes the blorbs or how to remedy the condition.
Oof, this wimpy little Koopaling...
What fools the others were to leave this one in charge!
Try to capture the exact moment when I defeat Bowser Jr. and Roy!
Then we can use it to get in good with Lord Fawful...
Bahaha!
Hey! Nobody holds an important conference without Bowser!
No, Dad! I swear!
I got your answer right here, pal.
I told you not to take all of it!
Yes, Your Robustness...
I'll see if there have been any developments in de-blorbing...
Rotten, lousy conference-planning jerks... They know how much I like a continental breakfast!
This is completely unforgivable.
Lord Junior... Must we keep at this?
My squad has lots of Goomba training to do. I don't wish to upset your father. Again.
What's that rumbling?
Whoa!
Oh...good. That sounds good.
Must have been the castle finally landing!
It's working! I feel fitter than ever!
Listen up! I'm heading to Peach's Castle.
You know what that means? We can go back to just being regular Minions!
They've gotta take us back, right? Right? If we say, "pretty please with sugar on top"?
No more help! Son of Bowser, what is your answer?
C'mon, let's get out of here.
What's going on?!
Take care of the place while I'm gone, OK?
"Pretty please with sugar on top?" Have some dignity, man.
It's a simple question. Are Bowser's minions evil?
We need to find a safe place and regroup...
And then track down Lord Bowser and Lord Junior.
You know...don't let those blorb things knock over my vases and stuff!
Look, I've started down a path...
This way! Let's go.
Heehee!
And though it may lead to me being pulverized by Bowser Jr. and Roy...
I only walk forward when I'm on a path!
I wish I could tell you that the young master had truly changed his ways.
Oh yeah, one more thing...
You know what? I'm gonna beat these guys! I can do it!
UGHHH...
But in truth, his days of mischief were not yet behind him.
Keep an eye on Junior, will ya?
So... Who are you?
Guys! Come look!
It was a team effort, Dad.
Still, he does listen to slightly more of the things I say, and he treats the Koopalings and Minions well.
He's a good kid...he just needs guidance.
I want him to grow up strong and wise...just like me.
Are...are you serious?
Anyway, didn't Fawful poison you? You should take some of this stuff!
He's less selfish, and he takes a bit more time to consider the consequences of his actions.
Yeah. Who are you?
Roy!
Dad! HEY, DAD!
On his good days, at least.
Really?
You answer it! Are we bad?
Did you know there's this ice in the Mushroom Kingdom that never melts?
It's true! Kamek told me about it!
It's called...um... Oh, yeah! Ever Ice! Didja hear me?! It never ever melts!
I often wonder about the day when he takes the reins from Lord Bowser...
So? What about it?
I suppose we'll cross that bridge when we come to it...
I wanna EAT IT! Just imagine! Crushed ice that never melts!
HMMM. Is that so...
Several days later...
Hey, Junior!
I found you some of that Ever Ice you were so excited about!
I feel...dry. How does my skeleton look?
Drivel?! I'm gonna look that up in the dictionary and then smack you with it!
Some what? Oh! You did?
That's cool. But I don't need it anymore.
Junior! What have you done to me?
The Koopa Paratroopa Trio joined your squad!
Then we'll get our minions back and dump you clowns in the lava!
There's a large ball of trouble rolling our way. I'm freaking out!
Is this one of your pranks?
What now? I don't have time for this!
Oh, I'm too late...
Who are you? Castle-to- castle sales...things?
Man, Bowser will let ANYONE in here...
Let's see...should it be Morton?
Get ready to lose!
Oh, it's your lucky day!
By virtue of simply being here, you have earned a FREE SEMINAR!
We're here to talk about...
Or maybe Larry?
No...you! GAAAH! THAT WAS MY LINE!
Yes, yes...I always knew it would come to this.
It's headed straight for you, milord!
Hmph. It's not doing anything.
Gahaha!
The fates have aligned to bring us together here...
Pfft.
Best Fitness Friends, huh?
Urghhh...
Come on, son. I'm talking about a REAL test of strength.
Whoa!
Or BFF for short! Heehee!
You're gonna fight me!
Ah, Junior. Found a new toy, huh?
FYI! FYI!
C'mon! I've got a squad ready and everything.
There's a conference on blorb prevention happening right now at Peach's Castle.
All of the most important leaders have been invited.
Aww, I'm sorry to hear you don't have time for personal fitness. I guess we'll be on our way!
Fighting against my own Dad...
...Except for you, of course. Hoo boy.
It's a dream come true! Let's do this!
Hey! Sales...things. Come back for a second!
All right! Don't hold back... You know I won't!
Ahh! It cures the blorbs, right?
I'll show you what it takes to be the boss!
It actually tones your skeleton?
Well, I'm impressed!
Everyone! Bow down before my son!
Hey, blorb! Watch where you're rolling! You're gonna mess up my decorative barrels!
Health!
Ugh, more yakking...
Iggy! Lemmy! Larry! Wendy! Morton!
Wait...this is your job, Kamek. Protect my barrels!
Beauty!
Do you think of us and the minions as the bad guys?
And a personal enrichment system known as Perfect You!
Nah, we're the good guys!
Get bouncy and smooth hair!
Teeth that don't fall out!
But you are forever kidnapping Princess Peach and inconveniencing that plumber...
Hey, Ludwig!
Muscles that quiver like whippets!
Only a monster would inconvenience a plumber! So what does that make you?
Yes, Lord Junior?
That's right, you can have all of these and more when you sign up with...
Is Dad...bad?
Best Fitness Friends!
I can't answer that for you.
Boooom! How about that? Did ya like that?
Chalk one up for Junior! Let's do it again!
We even brought samples!
Now I just need seven more wins!
All right, I'm working on a theory...
That overlarge Goomba may have been afflicted with a condition known as "the blorbs."
Wait, why am I complaining?
So...what should we do?
Everything is peachy at the moment.
What are you talkin' about?
And we will just control that which we can control, hm?
So! Now is the time to deal with the rest of these pests.
Oh.
Lemmy! Hey, Lemmy!
Dad! Check it out! The Skeletone Formula:D!
Whoa, tough guy. What's with the glasses?
Let me ask you a question, son of Bowser...
Wake up!
You got a lot of guts wearing sunglasses in front of ME.
Are you and your minions...evil?
Hmmmm... HUH?!
I'm having second thoughts...
What are you guys doing here?
And...the sweating has started...
Shut up! They'll hear you!
Hey, bro!
Oh...right. As you wish, milord.
Yeah, keep it down. The whole castle is under their control.
Wait! Don't eat all of it!
Late-breaking news flash, bro.
Didn't you hear me? We go until I win ten times!
All right, what did you do with all those blorbed Goombas?
Ugh... I'm sorry I couldn't stop them...
Mario and Luigi apparently took out that Fawful guy a while back.
I need six more wins!
Right. And to think, he's just goofing off with those Goombas during an emergency.
And when it's been so dusty around here!
Hmm...but I thought it was for the blorbs...
Wait...
All right, goombs! Bring it on!
Then again, I did inhale a lot of my kingdom. That's basically like the blorbs!
They're ready!
I still feel a little bloated. I'll try it!
It's time! Brute Force Minions!
Go forth and lay waste to the Mushroom Kingdom!
Seriously?
Junior wins again!
Did he say wise?
Eight more and it's all over!
Bahaha! You're joking, right? And people say I'm the crazy one!
Yeah.
All right! Junior is in your hands.
No clue?
This is an order! But also...I'm asking you as a concerned father.
Not one.
Bahaha!
So to be perfectly crystal clear... You're saying you don't remember me?
Oh...it hurts to laugh. But it's still so funny!
We met at Blubble Lake! We told him where the Koopalings were!
And then...*cough*...we changed sides and fought for Fawful...
Did he really forget all of that?
All right, Ludwig. I'm ready for the report.
GWAAARRGH!
Wait... Why is the number going up instead of down?
Hmph. A true Paratroopa always soars into battle, even knowing he will lose!
Gentletroopas, it's been an honor.
Thank you, Lord Bowser. I think you'll find it quite illuminating.
After all, you may not have noticed, being busy with Fawful and all that nonsense...
But your royal son, the young Lord Bowser Jr., has really started growing up!
Hmm...
What's that, goombie? Less talk, more fight!
Hold on just a second, Roy...
Uh...bro. I'm thinking we should just leave.
Also...why would you remind him about our treason?!
I see. Bring him to me!
Kamek! Get your quivering hump over to Peach's Castle right away!
Please... No more...
I know it's crazy, but... What if their products DO have an effect on the blorbs?
Yaaaah!
What's up, Dad?
That punk will eventually be our boss!
OH, COME ON!
In case you're wondering how this all turned out...
Ludwig tells me that you're growing up. I never gave you permission to do that!
Yeah, but for now we still report to Bowser. Do you remember what he said the other day?
There's something more important I need, Dad!
It's this great new toy! Let me tell you everything about it...
Well, I'd rather we could all just forget the whole thing. Hmph.
Don't worry. I'm still a kid, Dad. Oh, but I am a LOT stronger than I used to be!
Hmph. Yeah, I do...
Oh, yeah? Show me!
Hello! Is anyone here?
What does he care? I'm the one who found the Ever Ice!
After 36 hours of nonstop searching, I might add...
OK! Uh, how do you want me to do that?
Well, it wasn't easy, but I crammed 'em into a broom closet.
Had no idea we had so many brooms!
If the blorbs keep spreading, something's gonna give. Either the brooms or the blorbs!
Hello, there! My name's Kaley. And...HOW FIT DO YOU FEEL?
Oh, I know! I could just fight someone!
I thought the end was in sight... but now I'm not so sure.
Well, that was unexpected...
I hate sweepin'.
Go away.
At least we're in good hands if Lord Bowser ever decides to retire...
Too bad it was meaningless drivel!
And there HE goes again, not sweepin' a dang thing!
We're up to our eyeballs in blorbed Goombas! We don't have time for this sales pitch.
Kamek! Tell me you didn't work yourself into a frenzy over THAT.
...Would we call it a frenzy?
Neither father nor son is ever willing to concede...
Hey, Dad! Check it out!
Son, I'm kind of in the middle of something...
Wait, what IS that?
Lord Junior...I hate to bring this up, but your math seems to be off...
Who did this to one of my Goombas?!
Are you miserable lot all that's left of my troopers? Pathetic.
Well, let's get on with it. It's your only chance to defeat my son!
Hey. Roy.
Hey.
...It's kinda boring when we don't have to rescue or kidnap anyone, huh?
Yep.
Skip minigame and proceed with story? 
No 
Yes
The shape seems different than before somehow...
I bet the balls of light will be different too! Careful!

Nothing we can do... I guess we might as well let Bowser do his thing.
Maybe he'll create some more changes in his body environment...
Oh boy. I've seen these bugs. They live in Dimble Wood.
Bowser must have inhaled it with whatever else he ate.
But to have gotten this big... What's it been eating?
...Of course! This thing is blocking Bowser's flame pipe! No wonder he can't spit fire!

Do you want to practice? 
No.
Yes.

Hey, Luigi too!

No need for studying...
Time to play outside...
Be not alarmed.
We are Princess Lipid. We rule o'er yon mucus membranes.
Thou hast dropped something in yon mucus pool, methinks.
What hast thou dropped in our mucus pool? Mayhap 'twas this treasure of e'erlasting wonder?
Or mayhap thou hast dropped this shabby green mustachioed man?
We shall now ask for thy formal answer.
What hast thou dropped in yon mucus pool? Treasure of e'erlasting wonder. Shabby green mustachioed man.
So! Thine claim layeth upon this treasure of e'erlasting wonder? 'Twas an impulsive choice?
Lies!
Temptation surfaced upon thy face at the mere mention of the treasure of e'erlasting wonder!
Something else in there?
Ah... The shabby green man is thy brother, and better than a treasure of e'erlasting wonder?
...Tee hee! Very well.
We shall say that the shabby green man is what thou dropped! 
Hark! A landing to be lauded! Thine shabby brother is nimble!
To shabby, nimble green man and his loyal brother, we giveth the treasure of e'erlasting wonder!
You got a, uh...great treasure!
Honesty begets fortune...
If ever thou findst our words to be true, remember us!
Fare thee well!
What was that treasure of whatever wonder you got?
WOW!
If you wear those badges in battle, you'll see some special effects!
Oh yeah! Those things can turn the tide in battle!
Hey, you guys? Mario. Luigi.
Look! Bowser swallowed something!
OK, I have bad news. The Dark Star has copied Bowser...
It's unfortunate, but there's only one thing we can do about it.
We must join with Bowser for an epic battle with Dark Bowser!
Are you guys all good?
If you feel you have anything left undone, finish it now!
Being prepared for this fight is your highest priority!

See? What did I say? Helloooooo, chub.
Pump Works
Well, guys, looks like we can access that area again...
But there's no real need.
Flame Pipe
I'm not positive he can get himself back to normal fast...
I mean, this guy just plain likes eating.
Going the brute force route again, I see...
Gut Check

Something's happening to Bowser's arm!

What happened?
Flab Zone
Oh, boy. Looks like trouble up there.
Looks like it's up to us to catch that Dark Star!

Let's go!

Yes, yes. I hear you.
Hey! Everything OK up there?
Uh-oh, he's not answering. This is not good.
We'd better go check out that area that's reacting!
Well, his sudden weight gain must have produced some changes in his body...
Sounds like a perfect time to look for Princess Peach!
No need to shout! I hear you. Forgot the safe combo, huh?
Nothing we can do right now... but Bowser's in bad shape.
It's possible some changes will take place in his body...
No one mocks Bowser and gets away with it...
I'm just out of sorts, that's all.
I gotta pound some pipsqueaks and get my level back to a Bowser-worthy number!
Leg Outpost
So, you defeated Fawful, huh?
Pipe Yard
The second Star Cure is at Bowser's Castle, huh...
Nose Deck
Guess we should leave this one to Bowser for now...

Nobody'll get that Star Cure without the safe combination, so we'd better help Bowser.

Right now, Bowser is moving with , right?
Well, if you press  or , Mario and co. will move again.
Lumbar Nook
Chest Station
What's wrong?
We may be able to access some other areas of Bowser's body...
The circles represent places we can probably reach.
Just follow the paths to get to where you want to go.
Move with , of course.
Or you can just touch the circle you want to access.
When Mario and co. want to move, use  or .
Airway
Looks like we finally made it out of that messed-up area...
Challenge Node
Look! That area over there...
Hmph...
Something happened in his body! Let's go and check it out!
I've got news for you!
I wonder if there's a place where we could get ready...
For what lies ahead...
What is it now?
There's some new gear available at the gear shop!
Hey! You OK?
I heard the item shop has some new inventory!
An entry was added to the Guide.
I wonder what happened...
We'd better walk around a bit and see what's what.
Emoglobin juice is on sale right now!
Please do stop by Toad Square any time you like.
Look! There's a reaction in Bowser's stomach!
Look!
Over there! Some activity! Let's go check it out!
It sounds like they tossed the safe somewhere...
Whoa! Hey, Mario Bros.!
I came to see what was up with the security system, but...
I got lost. And I couldn't get this bridge working to go back.
It's easy, usually. To rotate the bridge, you hit the lever.
But I lost my lever-whacking wrench, so I can't do anything.
Mario, any chance you know how to hit far-off things?

Better to come back once you've gotten something...
This shape doesn't fit...
I spy with my little globin some suspicious ground areas...

When Bowser drinks, the water flows down into his belly...
But when he stops, the water level drops back down.
Look! Over there!
The wall that blocked the way! The water made it float up!
...Oh, I get it.
...Huh? You think Princess Peach might be up ahead?
...You may be right. Let's press on and keep our eyes peeled.
Of course, to do that, we'll need Bowser's cooperation!
HEY!
Can you drink some more water for me?
Uh... Um...
Let's swim over and look!
Oh, right!
To swim together, use .
Or, you can always use  and  to swim individually. It could come in useful!
Give it a try!
Of course!
Definitely!
Totally! Or not...
Phew...
All right! Let's move on!
Your body's in rough shape. There's like...filth and crust! Water might wash it out?
Oh yeah!
There are more details in the guide, but you can check it out later.
Good thing I planned ahead and gave you guys access to the star menu!
Oh yeah, the star menu lets you track all kinds of useful information.
You can press the START button to open it!
OK then, let's go look for Princess Peach!
Hey, guys... We don't really know WHAT could be waiting for us up ahead.
Just to be on the safe side, maybe you should both level up a little bit...
So, if you see any bad guys, take 'em out...and get all that sweet EXP!
Hey! Luigi, why are you goofing off up there?!
What to do...
Mario, we have to help.
Jump up and grab his legs so we can pull him down.
Phew...
Even inside Bowser's body there are enemies to fight.
Hey, Luigi!
Have you seen Princess Peach anywhere?
Hm... Not you either, huh...
Looks like she'll be tough to track down...
Oh! Right!
An entry was added to the Guide.
Mario!
Jump and stomp 'em!
Also...
You can tap this button at any time to bring up the mini map.
That's the best way to figure out where exactly we are.
The only downside is...it'll remind you that we're stuck inside Bowser's weird body...

Could this...possibly be... the shattered memory of the safe combination?!
Affirmative. Correct. There was large-scale trauma.
This memory was broken. Affirmative. Correct.
It must have been when the Fawful Express rammed him...
No wonder he can't remember that combination... So how do we get it back?
Stylus. Affirmative. Correct. Touch pieces with the stylus.
While touching the pieces, move them over the panel.
If the pieces stick and do not move, you have located the correct place.
The button at the bottom of the panel is the rotator. It will rotate a piece when touched.
Pieces must face the proper direction. Affirmative. Correct.
This method will allow for memory reorganization.
Do you understand? 
No.
Yes.
Mario! Luigi!
The button at the bottom of the panel is the rotator. It will rotate a piece when touched.
Pieces must face the proper direction. Affirmative. Correct.

You did it! Incredible! 9898  88241  983 That's the safe combination!

Here Fawful goes... The disappearing...
Forever disappearing...
WITH YOU!
Oops. I said too much.
What? You're still at it?
Why... The failing...
You...mustaches...with... why...fury...whenever...
Fawful...just wanted...some kingdom conquering...
Fawful tried... Fawful gave the 110 percents...
Fawful worked the overtime... Fawful was the team player...
Fawful put in the hours... Fawful got the hands dirty...
But every time... Always... The mustaches...arrive...
Always in Fawful's way... Alwaysalwaysalways...
Look, give up already.
Seriously, get over it.
You're done with evil.
I have remorse...
Fawful understands... Fawful gives up...
Fawful will disappear with no troubles...
Sounds good.
No more evil, OK?
The Dark Star... It's finally gone.
And the princess?
Is she all right?
I don't back down from anyone, but in this case I knew I couldn't match his brawn.
So naturally, I used my brain.
Wow! You really took down that Ludwig mannequin!
It wasn't an exact match— perhaps not my finest work...
Ah, but your beady little eyes couldn't tell the difference.
I guess this goes to show you, meathead... Never skip brain day!

Toadsworth, by boogity! I was looking for you!
Ah, Master Toadbert. Rather a serendipitous time to arrive.
Masters Mario and Luigi are drilling below as we speak.
Yes, it's a standard slooow- back-stimulation operation.
Really?! That sounds fascinating, by boogity!
You mind if I watch as it sloooowly works its magic?
Be my guest. In my experience, it takes a long time to sloooowly stimulate the back.
Why not rest one's fingers and eyes and enjoy some tea, hm?
Ahhhh! Toadsworth, your tea never fails to calm me down. Teatime is so restful...
Quite right--teatime is for taking a break from all cares.
I shall set my alarm to alert us when Bowser's back heals.
Until then, drink some hot tea, do some proper stretching, and let your cares melt off.
One mustn't ever rush!
It's vital to reflect occasionally on whether one is overdoing whatever it is one is doing.
Yes, take it slooow...
Indeed, slooooow...
Why not take a short tea break while you wait?
Once Bowser's back is better, Toadsworth's alarm will ring.
Stimulate that protrusion with your utmost vim and vigor!
Well, fancy meeting you here, Masters Mario and Luigi...
Whatever brings you two to a place like this, hm?
It's quite odd--for some reason this place soothes my soul...
Ho ho... I feel rather at home, like it's my very own room!
What's this you say? Bowser hurt his back?
Ah, and you intend to heal it in this place?
Now that you mention it, the floor here did just darken and become rather hard.
No doubt Bowser's back injury is the cause.
Ah, indeed, quite right.
This strange protrusion appeared only moments ago, as a matter of fact.
Shall we attempt to stimulate this spot?
TALLY HO!
...Rather too small an instrument to affect change, I'm afraid.
Ho ho ho ho...
Perhaps I'd best simply leave you masters to it, hm? I shall observe from a safe distance.
I hereby cede leadership to Masters Mario and Luigi.
HO HO!
I daresay it's working! Yes, sloooowly working!
Don't get too excited, or you'll throw it out of whack again!
Mr. Mario! Mr. Luigi!
I suspect that Bowser has learned the spike ball move!
The what?
Yes, by boogity! By stimulating this spot, we've made his muscle loose and incredibly limber!
So now he can curl up into a spike ball?
Correct. You simply switch to that action icon with  and activate it with .
Hey, up there!
How's that spike ball working out for you?
Wow!
Peach's Castle!
Listen, Peach is being held somewhere in the castle...
The Dark Star is awakening... You need to find Princess Peach as fast as you can!
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
MARIO AND LUIGI!
No, listen! When you face off in battle...
Don't forget you can count on us!
We'll help you from in here!
We'll all work together!
Uh-huh, that's right! I'm not alone in here!
Yes... Mario and Luigi are in your body too...
Never mind... Just remember... We're in this fight, too...
DON'T FORGET!
This must be the final battle!
I can feel the dark power emanating like crazy!
Listen! I have a favor to ask!
Interesting... By spinning, you drove that thing into the floor.
Just like a drill!
Neat! So you'll switch to Drill Bros. by pressing ? And then start digging with ?
I bet that Drill Bros. move can do more than bypass things...
What you should do is try it on suspicious spots in the ground.
Try it out in various places!
I...don't think you can fit through there...
An entry was added to the Guide.
Whoa, I didn't know you could do that! Show me more!
Very impressive... by both of you!
Now you can go under the fence!
Huh?
Larry? Kamek? Who was that?
We're cute!
And we're brutes! And we don't ask questions—we just shoot!
Whoa! Almost walked right off this cliff. That would NOT have been funny.
Bahaha!
What's that? Someone telling a joke? Well, are you going to share?
I don't like...cliffhangers.
Oh, it's just you g—.
Ooh, I like the sound of BFF Castle.
Best Fitness Friends! Or should I use the real name, since it's just us...
Yes, do it. Who is stopping you?
We're the BFFs, and we'll take your loot! Get your dirty work done—in style to boot!
That's why we're...Brute Force Federation!
We are losing the battles and the war! I must urge you to consider some new formations...
You know, if you add several of the same type of minions, you could get some group attacks going...
SING IT, GIRL!
Ugh, that is SO lame...
Beef? Did you just SAY something? And was that thing "lame"?
Seriously, Beef. What's wrong with you? You're freaking me out!
I really should NOT freak out with all the supplements I have in my system right now.
Don't worry your pretty little head off about him! Let's just go.
We've got to give Roy the BFF treatment next, remember?
What's the matter? Cat got your...face? You're the one who named us, remember!
I wanted to call us the Cutie Coalition!
But nooooo! Not intimidating enough for old Beef!
Oopsie!
Oopsie?!
Eeep.
...Sorry, Iggy.
Catch ya never! Teehee!
Ha! Good one, Kaley!
These Koopalings are just too easy. I'm not even feeling a burn.
Don't sweat it, Dieter. Save your strength for...
TAKING OVER THE ENTIRE MUSHROOM KINGDOM!
Yes! Peach's Castle will be Fawful's Castle.
And then he'll forget all about Bowser's Castle and it will be BFF Castle!
And we'll even get those cute little minions to command as a bonus.
Iggy! IGGY! Where are you?!
Probably off laughing to himself. Like weirdos do.
I. Do. Not. Care. I hope he stays gone.
I'm not so sure... Iggy is weird, yes. But he's weird like a fox.
I just hope he didn't fall off this cliff. It's ludicrously far down!
Young Master...
No... Knowing Iggy, he's probably already back at the castle, laughing maniacally to himself.
Iggy has gone missing!
BAHAHA!
Brute! Force! Federation!
Whoa, hey, Luigi! Long time, no see!
What are you doing out and about today?
Mario! How's the jump holding up these days? Knees OK?
Remember, use  for Mario and  for Luigi!
Like gossip? Then get chatty with folks by pressing !
This is Peach's Castle! ...But you knew that.
Ooooog. Mario!
Phew! You'll fix me up, won't you?!
I can't wait, seriously. Not a fan of the blorbs.

Muh muh muh! He is very round. I am amused!
First, your beating of Midbus! And then, the chubbening with the special dishes of tastiness!
All in my master planning!
Oh, I have such chortles! There was a slight changing to my perfect plan!
Yes, Fawful said "plan."
A plan of Bowser inhaling Peach, sending the Mushroom Kingdom into the hands of Fawful!
But now for the changing. I am needing the princess!
Fawful tells you yes.
But now I am needing her right this instant! 
Come out for the playing! Come to Fawful!

What ARE you?! Do you have a KO wish?
Nothing but trash...
MUH MUH MUH!
You are famous. Red and green.
This castle now belongs to Fawful.
You go no farther than how far you are!
You amuse me. I have fought Bowser. You are much smaller.
Well, bring it on, then! C'mon, give it your best shot!
You speak rudely. And I permit it just this once...
Soon Dark Star awakes. And soon means later!
Try to interfere with it, and taste my wrath!
He is of trash. And you are. You, trash. I call you trash.
Go be trashy in this trash hole with this trash robot forever!
Go! Super Ultra Great Mega Trashy Monster Junker Bot!
What?! Nothing?!
Move. MOVE! Stupid junk!
No one pressed "dance"! You are broken!
Oh. Well, good. Now you work.
Trash these trashmen!
Bowser! His safe got tossed into this junk depository!
Huh? You think we ought to return to Bowser's body?
Right... He might stand a better chance at storming the castle.
Let's go!

Do you have the globin to take our verrrrry tough test? 
Nope.
Sure.

Now, the verrrrry tough Totemglobin test...

Remember the enzyme that falls when Bowser's mouth flashes...
That's a bit too much practice eating, no?
Did you hear that?!
Remember where that piece is!
When you eat a piece of carrot that holds that enzyme, it flashes briefly. 
What if we break up these big pieces...
Using that helps Bowser digest really fast, huh?
I wish there were an easier way to break all of them up...
A mouth flash means pay close attention to the swallowed bit.
Keep tapping to break up those big pieces!
For inside that piece hides the digestive enzyme.
Huh?!
This is what tiny super-digestive enzymes look like.
You remember where that piece is? Break it up!
Yes, yes, yes. Practice is over...
If you delete random pieces, the enzyme fades to blue and grows ever weaker.
Go, face-stuff challenge!
It's red right now! It can digest all the pieces at once!
This giga-carrot includes a super-digestive enzyme that quickly digests food.
Found it!
Tapping all those pieces Bowser ate sure isn't easy...
Find that enzyme inside one of those pieces, and activate it right away!
When Bowser's mouth flashes, some enzyme thingy goes active inside one of the pieces!
I wonder if this will make Bowser be able to eat a ton.
Let's tap and see!
Ah, these tiny enzymes hide within other pieces as well...
Ah.
Use it while it is red, and all eaten food will be digested at once.
Ready?
Skip minigame and proceed with story? 
No 
Yes
That thing we just heard was a tiny enzyme!
Has this crystal ever been wrong? It certainly has not.
The bug is indeed one of the sages, of that I am sure.
How sure am I that it has one of the cures? 100% sure.
But it's not in the forest at all! It's inside Bowser's body!
Bowser ate it in Dimble Wood and now it's in Bowser's body!
That crystal of yours is totally off the mark!
Star... Star Cures...
Three Star Cures...
Three sages hold three Star Cures...
They'll cure all the world's ills...
Are you an expert in crystal reading? You are not. Are you out of your league? You are.
Was the bug in the forest? It was. And that means the crystal speaks the truth.
Moreover, now that you know the sage's true location, you will beat Bowser to the punch!
So all we have to do is find these three cures?!
Can the cures destroy the Dark Star, as well?
There are three sages. There are three cures. Each holds one.
A forest... Dimble Wood!
That's all I needed to hear, baby!
So I just need to grab three Star Cures?!
What? YOU can't find them!
You know Mario and Luigi will find all three!
Aw, cry more, you big baby! You're just ticking me off!
You're about as annoying as that Chippy thing in my gut!
Well, whatever. OK, chumps! Mario! Green 'Stache! Nice guys finish last!
I'm getting those three cures and taking Peach's Castle!
Hey! What sort of person is the first sage, anyway?
Hmm... Yes, indeed...
That would take a lot of explaining...
Uh... Doctor?
Ocean... Sandy beach... Cliff...
Is one of the three sages in this scenery? Indeed he is.
The ocean... Plack Beach!
Yes, indeed... Near the ocean, but in a very high place...
Does this sage dwell on high where the air is thin? He does.
I'm sure we'll deal with it! Let's get a move on, guys!
Ahem... Was I talking? I was. Now, as a doctor, I can't recommend thin-air travel.
Oh, yeah, right, you're a doctor...
Now, I can permit thin-air travel provided you pass a brief examination.
Doctor, your next patients are here.
GRAVE ILLNESS!
OK, right! Gotcha! Where are the sages?
Do these two men have an incredibly grave illness? Yes.
Will there be catastrophic results if we do not cure their ills? There certainly will.
A vision emerges! One is likely in a forest!
Silence! You men harbor a virus most deadly.
Is it gradually emerging? It most certainly is.
This crystal imaging is how the doctor diagnoses patients.
Watch carefully.
Yes... Do I see it? I do. And did it emerge? It did.
A most deadly virus that will surely spell your doom...
It is...called...
BOWSERITIS!
MWAHAHA! 
Somebody page me?
Heeheehee!
Whoahohohoho! Hohohohohoho!
IMPOSSIBLE!
Is there anything I don't know? No. The answer to that is no.
However! All my skills and magic powers are for naught in the face of certain realities...
Those barriers are absolutely, TOTALLY un-knock-downable...
Because of whose power? The Dark Star! The Dark Star!
Boy... Way to put a gloomy spin on things...
The way things stand, we can't get anywhere near the castle...
And the fate of the kingdom teeters on the brink...
Is it too early to give up? It indubitably is.
I lack the power to break the blockade, that is true.
But does the crystal hold another message? It does.
It does?
STAR CURES!
Star Cures?
You're right. Let's just head to Dimble Wood.
Wait! It emerges!
An image emerges!
Look! Is this the first sage? It most certainly is!
What? That's the... creature we battled inside Bowser's body?
Oh... Really? Huh... OK, yeah! I remember!
It ran off after we beat it, didn't it?
That thing is a sage?
Oh yeah... I guess that's true. It's pretty lucky the first sage is inside Bowser's body!
We can just head back inside and grab the Star Cure from that bug-sage thing!
Is it annoying that I got mixed up in this? It is.
This way.
Silence. First, the blorbs that assail the Mushroom Kingdom...
The Star Cures are the only means to stopping the blorbs.
And with the three Star Cures, surely you will have power...
The power to break the castle blockade? I believe so.
Will they help you destroy the Dark Star? I do not know.
But one thing is crystal clear. You must get the Star Cures.
They'll cure the blorbs?! We've gotta get them!
So where? Where are the Star Cures?
Indeed! A virus most vile shows itself at last!
And is this the virus that plagues you men?
It is. And is it a pox on body and soul? It is.
A pox? You're a pox!
I must be frank with you. Bowseritis is powerful.
Recovering from it takes quite a bit of time.
I'm prescribing ten days' worth of antibiotics.
Take these three times a day. With food, preferably.
Mario! And Green 'Stache!
So you two dolts wanna get the Dark Star, huh?
AND you're trying to retake Peach's Castle?
No way! Both the Dark Star and Peach's Castle should be mine!
THEY WILL BE MINE!
Still..don't have... my...A game...
So...very...weak...
I see. So that is the reason you have come to me.
If nothing is done, will the Mushroom Kingdom fall? It will.
We heard word that you know all there is to know about the Mushroom Kingdom.
We were hoping you might know how to break down the barriers at Peach's Castle...
Hahahaha!
There it is again!
It just absorbed more of Bowser's genetic code...
Now's our chance! After it!
It just spit fire, didn't it...
And before, it punched through a wall...
Just like Bowser...
We have to stop it from getting any more of Bowser's genetic code or we're in BIG trouble.
Chase it down!

The questioning... Yes, you ask Bowser questions. He will hear you by the power of globin.
I don't mind telling you that his answers and those in the quiz may be very similar-ish.

Please step upon the stage there, if you would.
HUZZAH!

I am the head customer-service Toad, and I am pleased to have the chance to serve you today.

His last-ditch explosion rescued us all!
Everyone... Thank you...
You've saved our dear Mushroom Kingdom.
Princess! OH, PRINCESS! Such joy... You are safe!
I'm simply awash with relief!
Listen, I'd advise not thinking about it too deeply, OK?
It's all in the past, and what you don't know won't hurt you!
Yup. Your minion.

GAAH! BAAH!
If we go that way, we'll be KO'd in no time.
Let's find another route.
Another near miss... We almost had it that time too...
That Dark Star... It's definitely absorbing Bowser's traits one by one...which isn't good.
Next time, we HAVE to get it!
Let's stimulate Bowser's muscles to fire him up!
Just jumping's not enough to get these muscles going...
When you land, press the button to stomp really hard!
OK, now Luigi!
Looks like you need to press the button of the bro on the bottom.
If you alternate stomps left and right, you jump higher and stimulate the muscles more.
Time your button presses to keep the jumps going, OK?
Ah!
Looks like you keep stomping by holding the button down...
Maybe you should press and hold those buttons a bit?
Stupid battery died!
Battery dies in 30 seconds!

Yes
GLOBIN!
The wandering Emoglobin is back. I come bearing knowledge. And globin.
So, wide-ish, open-ish gaps... Hm... What's a globin to do?
While you move with , press  to jump at the same-ish time and laugh at gravity!
This is the way of all globin. Do this, and you will grow three mustache sizes, O hairy ones.
Go! Be globin!
I think we may have finally got out of Bowser's body...
I wonder where we are? Somewhere underground...
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
Oh? These are the Toad Town Caves?
Really? You think? OK, if you say so.
Wait, that reminds me! Peach's story!
The Dark Star is beneath Toad Town!
I have chortles!
You guys hear that?
Fawful's nearby!
Talk about a dilemma! Fawful has Peach...
But he's also looking for the Dark Star!
We have to find that Dark Star before Fawful!
By the way, if you get lost, just confirm where you are on the map.
Let's go!
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
You can't escape, Mr. Runs-a-lot!
He's just ahead.

Lord Bowser! Your Missingness! Where are you?!
If you're not here, say, "NOT HERE!"
Kamek joined as a minion!
And so, young Bowser Jr. had already driven away many of his allies.
AHA!
Of course, I couldn't blame them for leaving, given his behavior...
Young Master!
...Where is everyone?
And while I may have been tempted to abandon him as well, I clung to the hope that he'd come to understand things...in time...
So what?
Oh! I have a great idea!
Gotta follow that guy!
I have copied all that is you. You are no longer necessary.
Hey! No more running!
Hand over Princess Peach and that dark power thingie!
Hey, where're you running? Come back here, you coward!
Don't forget to restore your HP and BP!
Yeah... True...
Welcome to Toad Town!
Dr. Toadley's clinic is over in the mall...
Welcome to Toad Town!
Oh! Wow! Hey! Mario! Welcome back!
You heard the mall is open for business?
Stop on by!
Oog... Hey, Mario...
Listen, don't worry... I'm getting better...
All thanks to that awesome Dr. Toadley...
Hey! Mario! Guess what?! The mall is straight ahead!
Yeah, it's sort of a snazzy, hip new shopping district.
All kinds of shops in one convenient location!
Bloooorb. Can't move...
Hi there, Mario! How've you been?
You seem pretty upbeat and mellow...
You always do, I guess. Being upbeat in a crisis is the way to go!
Bloooorb... Mario... I need help...
West of here is a tunnel that connects to the Toad Town Caves.
I've seen three Paratroopas hanging out over there from time to time...
Oog... Ate a weird mushroom and ended up all round...
Oog... Hey, Mario...
Look...at my body... Can't really move...
Dr. Toadley says I'll get better, but...
That doctor's...weird. So I'm...oog...worried.
You think sunbathing might make me better?
Anyway, Toadley's clinic is over in the mall...
Oog... The blorbs? I have the blorbs?
The tougher things get, the more upbeat I'll be!
Oog... Want to shop... at the mall...
Shopping mall straight ahead!
Hrrrnngh... Hrrrnnnn...
No good... Can't move...
Who opens a shopping mall at a time like this?
So stupid! Everyone's down with the blorbs!
Yeah, the blorbs are not cool. And the princess is gone too.
But hey, that's why this is the EXACT time to cheer everyone up!
Mario! They finally cured those stupid blorbs!
Now once Peach returns, we can forget all this!
Good luck, Mario!
Hey... You just ACTED like me.
That doesn't mean you ARE me. You're no match for the real deal, original Bowser...
Right... You...
LOST.
GWAHAHA!
Great dark hurricane!
Seriously, perfect backdrop for an awesome final battle!
You really sweat the details!
Listen up! You're saying the kingdom will vanish?
NOT TODAY!
THIS KINGDOM IS ALL MINE!
SO YOU VANISH!
No... Miracle TOADLEY Cure...
You got the Miracle Cure!
Miracle Toadley Cure...
Thanks for everything, Dr. Toadley!
We'll use it right away!
The blorbs are cured?! Yes!
Y'know... Mario and Luigi and me, we did collect the Star Cures...
Ahem! Is it time to go? It is! To the final battle!
The Miracle Cure will smash that blockade!
Hmmm... It's emerging... Will it emerge? Probably...
Is this good timing? It is!
For you seek wisdom about the three sages, and I have it!
=== １月末版 終了 === １月末版は ここまでとなります。 ご確認ありがとうございました。
Will the blockade fall to that cure's power? It certainly will.
But will it defeat the Dark Star? That, we simply do not know.
The power of the Dark Star's darkness is unfathomable...
Well, first we'll get into Peach's Castle, and then we'll use our power to do...something.
Let's get a move on! To Peach's Castle!
Is the Star Cure in Bowser's body? It is...
With this we can destroy the blockade at Peach's Castle!
Is the third Star Cure near Plack Beach? It is...
Do I have something for you before the final battle? I do.
Will it be useful? It surely will. Is it wonderful? It certainly is.
Does my intern have it at the front desk? She probably does.
Can that wait? It can.
Let's ask one thing at a time of our Miracle...Cure.
CUUURE!
What? What was that?
Must I chuckle? I must. Go outside and you'll see.
As expected, I have... trounced the blorbs!
A second Star Cure... Hmmm... No sign...
The second Star Cure... The sage Kuzzle had it...
It was taken from him and stored somewhere...
YOU WILL!
Will you guys make it happen? You will!
Do I need my crystal to tell me that? I do not!
Incredible! Have all three Star Cures been found? They have!
And did I ever doubt you guys would find them? Never!
So what do we do with the three cures?
Silence! 
Have I done it? I have! Did I do it? I did!
I have bonded the three Star Cures to create...
What shall I call it? Miracle Toadley Cure!
Miracle Cure! Great name!
Secret note? What might this be?
Weird...
It might be some kind of hint.
Let's remember it, just in case. I'll make sure not to forget.
