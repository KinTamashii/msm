There's many dangers in them caves. Stuff could fall on you, or a monster could pop out and CHOMP!
You need to be on your toes. You don't want to lose them diamonds you went about collectin'.
Hrmm! Hrmm! So that's how it is.
Hrmm! Hrmm! You stop right there!
Oh! Incredible! You did it! The high score is yours!
Oh! Ho-ho! Not bad, friend of mine!

Now perk up them ears, boys, 'cause I got one more verrrry important thing to tell you.
As time goes by, Mario, that light you got is gonna get dimmer and dimmer.

So, I reckon maybe you fellers ought to practice grabbin' batteries just a touch.

These are Chuckoroks.
Oh... So you probably want us to let you pass, huh?
Yeah, well, I'm sure you guys know this is the border of the Mushroom Kingdom.
Look! One shot out a rock.
You touch one, it shocks you. It startled me, too. I will move.
That's right, it's the border, and since we're the border security, we can't let you in...
...until you do some jumping worthy of the Mario Bros. name!

The rules are really simple! Just jump to avoid touching the royal Border Line!
