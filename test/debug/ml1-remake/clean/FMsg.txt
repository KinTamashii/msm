Lissen up! This'll shock you!
This ship is the world-renowned S.S. Chuckola! Uh-huh!
We're haulin' Chuckola Cola! You hear me??? Shockin', huh?
HP fully restored! BP fully restored!
(Neon Eggs are pretty...)
And with that, please excuse me.
(Once this sign is finished, Yoshi Theater will be complete... Ooh, I can't wait!)
(Once the theater is done, the wall by the door will be so sparkly!)
What's that? There's something on my face?
...O M-Master! Master! You mustn't listen! You can't listen!
All of this talk is just meant to swindle you out of your money again! It's all lies! LIIIIIIES!!
Eh? You say I look like Bubbles, the legendary soda maker?
I see... You just have to have the decoration on this sign...
(Wow! Yoshi faces... Everywhere!♪)
This sign is my theater's face.
You must find something else that can be used to decorate my grand sign, understood?
(So this is a movie theater...)
Why, do you mean... Neon Eggs?
This movie theater is now finally nearing completion.
They say this place was built for Yoshis by a great Yoshi enthusiast.
While we've certainly heard of Yoshis here in Beanbean, most people have never seen them...
This place could be all the rage!
Yes! I shall trade you this for the seven brilliant colors of the Neon Eggs!
I still need  more! Don't leave me hanging!
Heh heh heh... That's because...
Will the two of you agree to this?
When Yoshis eat a particular kind of food, they lay Neon Eggs, or so they say.
Inside that movie theater are seven hungry Yoshis...
So, find that particular food and give it to the Yoshis inside.
Once you get a Neon Egg, it means the Yoshi's stomach is filled. It also means...
I'm...
Everyone's happy!♪
Wah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You did it! You did it!
Bubbles's...
...Right?
Thanks to you two, my theater is now complete! Marvelous!
Very well! As promised... Here is your reward!
Younger brother!
In-Incredible, Master! Thinking not only of yourself...
...but of all the Yoshis, too!
My name is Boddle...
Younger brother of the legendary soda maker. As you can see, I'm rich enough to own my own theater.
I also happen to be president of the Yoshi Fan Club.
You two! Don't just stand there staring! Thank my master!
And once you're done thanking him, hurry up and get those Neon Eggs!!!
Hey! What's with you two?!?
This theater was designed by a Yoshi-loving chap specifically for the enjoyment of the Yoshis.
Now that you mention it, there is someone in this theater who's well versed in Neon Eggs.
You should talk to that individual about what food makes Yoshis lay Neon Eggs and where to find it.
Still a ways to go!
Halfway there!
Only one left to go!
You can't just waltz up and start talking to my master!
You weasels! Look at you! There's no doubt in my mind that you've come looking for money!
Well, I'll have you know that my master is very busy!
He doesn't have time to waste on the likes of you!
Be off! OFF, I say!
Huh? The Beanstar? Busted into four pieces?
Silence, you twit!
Excellent! We're going to be rather busy preparing for our grand opening! Pardon us!
HEY! What are YOU staring at?
You got a Beanstar piece!
Only  more to go!
You got a piece of the Beanstar!
Now you have all four pieces!
Hurry! Back to Beanbean Castle!
What's this?
Coming Soon! The Action Blockbuster: Mario & Luigi!
...That sounds so cool! Oooh, I can't wait!
Shh! Shh! If you understand, hurry up and find the Neon Eggs!
(Hooray!)
(It's complete!)
(Banzai!)
So, uh... What did you want to talk about?
...Yes, of course. Fine, fine.
I suppose I could decorate the sign with something else and give that sparkly thing to you...
No! No! You mustn't! Master, you mustn't!!
However... Only on one condition...
Im-Impossible, Master! Washed-up middle-aged men such as these could never get the Neon Eggs!
Hmm. Well done... I did well, asking you two.
My, Neon Eggs are beautiful. On the sign you go!
Hmm... The Neon Eggs have at last appeared... Perhaps...
ONE!
Ahhhh!
A trap door!
Hah! A move most classic by the genius that is Fawful.
I don't have time for fightings of fairness with foul Goombas.
Come, Fawful.
It's time to destroy Mario and that other guy!
I am busy with schemings, O Great Cackletta!
So, this is how it ends...
Come on—let's move. We need backup, and we need it NOW.
Do you...hear something?
What happened... Why was I...
Ah, I get it. Fawful must have been controlling me somehow...
That's right! Our real enemy is up ahead...
Join us, Master Ludwig!
Hah... Har... Chortle...
Are you...the Goomba from the mountain?
Is it...over...? I think it's over...
Um, yep! That's me!
You're mad? Right now? It's so hard to tell...
I know he looks scrawny, but he's the one who brought us all this far.
The way he was talking was definitely strange. Not like Lord Bowser at all.
He said to destroy Mario. I hate him too, but that seems a bit hard-core...
Just one measly Goomba... Impossible...
I know I'm just a humble Goomba... just a run-of-the-mill Bowser fanboy.
Mayday!! Mario and the green guy have arrived!
Hmph. Normally I'd laugh and kick you to the curb about now...
At first, I never thought I could be a worthy captain for you fine Minions.
What should we do, Cap?
Fight our archnemesis, Mario? Or confront that imposter?
But you might be telling the truth...
But then I met a quiet Shy Guy captain with still waters that run deep...
Listen up. We can battle with Mario any old time.
Our main concern right now is Fawful and Lord Not-Really-Bowser!
Our Captain Goomba may look goofy, but he's really special! A model Minion!
But my loyalty to Lord Bowser is stronger than anything in the world!!
A mischievous Boo captain who's actually quite kind...
A Koopa Troopa captain who rhymes for attention but is beyond loyal...
You recruited Koopaling Lemmy!
You recruited Koopaling Ludwig!
The Notorious Koopalings... Private Goomp's Trio...
With every new member, the Goomba Squad grew stronger. And so did I!
That's how I know we'll be OK. NO ONE can beat this team.
This is it...
He's here...
Fawful!!
♪Fawful is king of everything...♪
I...I get it now. You want me to prove myself once and for all!
Now then... Have the saying of my most glorious of names!
OK then! I'll do it! LET'S DO THIS!
Nice try, but your spray has no power over us anymore!
I don't have time for Goomba speeches. Prepare for battle immediately!
It's not just me, either! All of us Minions are immune to your spell!
Ummm... Master Ludwig? Sir?
I'm sorry to impose, but is something wrong?
We're all here to rescue Lord Bowser! We Minions ONLY answer to him!
Summon the other Koopalings.
All of them. Now.
Wow. You really think that Goomba's the real deal, don't you?
You are as annoying as an itch for which there is no scratching!
Huh? OK...
Ha! Don't be crazy.
I'm just gonna let him do the dirty work until Bowser's back!
I'll be blunt. You're going to fight all seven of us.
Bahaha... You're the worst!
WHAAA?! I have to fight all seven of the notorious Koopalings? But why?!
Because. I. Said. So.
You said earlier that no one in the world is more loyal to Bowser than you are.
I'm going to test that theory. I wanna see how much Minion spirit you really have.
This is all so sudden... I'm a tad flabbergasted.
Just as I thought. You've only made it this far because of the Koopalings.
It wasn't because of your own loyalty or abilities at all, was it?
Hey! Let go of me!
This is the part where you follow me!!
Bahahaha!
Look, you were pretty cool earlier, but there's no need to go overboard.
Just simmer down, yeah? These are the Koopalings we're talking about!
Hmph! Pesky little cretin...
Soon you will be having regret for defying the Great Cackletta!
Captain Goomba! Let's get moving. I'm with you until the bitter end.
There will be no forgiveness for you, Fawful! The Koopalings... The Trio...
You used diabolical tricks to brainwash and control my friends!
WHAT? You too?! Am I the only sane one here?
I am having little to no understanding. You are evil Minions, yes?
You should fall to your knees of worship for a genius of evil such as Fawful!
Incoherent insect!! Idiotic imbecile!
Stop saying weird things in weird ways! Enough is ENOUGH!
GIVE US BACK OUR BOWSER!
TROUBLE! We've got trouble!
You and everyone you care for will pay dearly for making a fool of me!!
Hahahaha! Oh, the chortles I am having!
What ARE those things?!
You mean because Lord Bowser isn't really Lord Bowser?
Welp! It is what it is. Let's go, team!
Did I not already tell you the news of your ultimate sadness?
We're not really going to fight. Am I right?
LORD BOWSER IS NOT... Wait... What? How did you know?!
He's asking a lot. But sure! Why not?
♪Bowser is not a thing that is here... Your tears make hee and har and cheer...♪
What would you have us do, Captain?
That's Lord Bowser's body, but his mind...
His mind is being controlled by someone else.
For crying out loud... I think we scraped the bottom of the captain barrel.
♪He's gone! He's gone! Fawfully-doo! Just like, soon, the one who is you!♪
My friends! My BROTHERS! Our journey is at its end.
Fawful said Lord Bowser is "not of this world anymore."
Yet there he was, acting really odd. It's the only logical explanation.
I...will...DESTROY YOU!!
If we survive this next trial, Lord Bowser awaits us.
Go ahead and have searchings for all of the eternities! Hah!
It's a double-edged sword to admit this, but...
Mario and Green Guy will surely defeat that faker.
Those guys are so strong... It make me SO MAD...
Huh. It's weird hearing you talk so much. You're usually such a shy...um...fella.
Yeah, well, this really makes me mad. I refuse to let this go unpunished.
Anyway, that will give us the chance to rescue the real Lord Bowser.
And this time, we won't fail! We'll be at our king's side before the day is done!
N-No... I'm really not...
I don't get it... How could a single Goomba do such great things...
I may just be a weak, run-of-the-mill Goomba...
What's wrong, Ludwig?
Nothing... I just have a lot on my mind. Let's get moving!
Hey, you! Imposter face!
Fawful... The one called Goomba has seen through my disguise.
Do not concern yourself with sad worryings over pesky Goombas!
My plans of backup are having their own plans of backup!
Whether we're up against weird machines...or weirder Fawful...
Whether it's the green Mario Bro... or even Mario himself...
You really think so?! Heh. Heheh. Heehee.
You might as well surrender! It's the end of the line for you jerks!
From this moment on, no matter what challenge we face, we WILL prevail!
Watch it, Goomba breath! Don't go getting a big head over this!
So let's go show the world what we're made of!
These puny worms have a point, I'm afraid.
Ah, sorry! My head will remain roughly as proportional as it currently is, sir!
This is for all the marbles! For our king!
Mario and his green sidekick will be here soon.
This doesn't mean it's over, either. You're just one step closer.
Goomba! No...CAPTAIN Goomba. You're OK in my book.
Yeah! This is for you, Lord Bowser!!
And before me stand the weirdly brave ranks of Bowser's Minions.
My, my, what a pickle this is. And I DESPISE pickles.
Bahaha! Prepare to get gotten!
Sir... I... THANK YOU!!
GOOMBA SQUAAAD!!
When life closes a pickle jar, it opens...
Geez, don't make me regret saying somethin' nice!
I hope you know that this whole time...
I've been going easy on you!
CHAAAARGE!!!
Three... Two...
Try acting like a real captain for longer than five minutes at a time, OK?
Enough talk. Show me what you're made of, little Goomba.
Sir, yes, sir! I'll work on it, milord!
OK! Here we go!
Goomba Squaaaad! Moooove out!!
How can this be?! It simply doesn't make sense...
...I don't know what just happened, but let's never speak of it again.
We lost. US! The mighty Koopalings! It's so wrong it's almost funny.
Ludwig was really trying his hardest too!
CHAAAAARGE!
Shut your stupid mouth before I shut it for you!!
Hmph. I can't believe you actually came.
*sigh* I hate to admit it, but I guess this means you're the real deal.
Your Minion spirit is... beyond compare.
No way are we lettin' you past this point!
Huh?
HEY!
You've got a lot of nerve to ignore the great Ludwig!
Yeah! I'm not gonna let some goofy Goomba disrespect me like that!
Master Ludwig! Master Lemmy! Stay out of my way, or else!
Whoooa there, cowboy...
No! No! No! This is all wrong! You must start over from scratch!
Step on these little foot marks!
Try it!
Yes! That's it! That will do fine! Next! On to the next one!
Let's see... The next design is...
First, drink up, so you can pump out that water!
Once you're pump-ready, step on these little foot marks!
Splendid! We're all done here!
That's all I have to tell you! So get started on your first assignment with all speed!
This means I must pay you with a bean-like thing, as promised!
Go next door and get your pay!
As for design, anything will do! Just give me a red color!
I want something in yellow! Oh! And in a checked pattern!
Honestly! What is one to do with such riffraff?!?
Oh! Welcome! WELCOME!
Yes, yes, whatever. Am I correct in assuming you're interested in the Splart Assistant opening?
Fine, fine. If you do a decent enough job, I'll pay you.
What? Do you have some sort of complaint? Hm? Hm? HM?
That's better. Now then...
You can help me with my Splart right away!
But you must be snappy! Just do it and get it done!
I'm going to be SO busy getting ready to open my store. I don't think I'll be back here for a while.
So, take care!
Give me some purple! Purple with a polka-dot flare!
I'm depressed! I crave orange! But with a star!
Remember, to make a star pattern, just hit two or more Designbombs at once!
Fine! FINE! I'll explain the method to my genius! Though the genius of Splart defies explanation...
First, you must dye the fabric!
Press the  Button to shoot water at the Designbomb!
Try it, already! Try it!
The color of the Designbomb you hit...
colors the fabric!
Oh. By the way... If you hit two Designbombs at the same time...
then the fabric color becomes a mixture of those two colors!
Don't forget! It's vital to Splart!
Oh! And one more teensy thing! If you're dyeing fabric and you think "Barf! That's all wrong!"
...Just talk to Bleetch! He'll make the fabric nice and shiny white for you!

Once you're done dyeing, then you choose your design!
...alters the design on your duds!
So you get to shoot water at the artsy bombs again! Isn't it just so fun you could dye?!?
I am called Harhall, genius designer. And I am also called Bleetch. Yes! We are one and the same!
The design of the Designbomb you shoot...
Did you know?
Did you know?!?
*** Harhall's Quick Notes ***
To ensure that Designbombs don't get ickily mixed-up...
Be sure to remember which Designbombs come out of which pipes.
Rear Pipe: → Yellow Designbombs Middle Pipe: → Blue Designbombs Near Pipe: → Red Designbombs
Once you're done with the design, I'll decide if it perfectly matches the artistic vision of Splart!
So, yeah. Anyway, that's the method to my genius...
And now I'll need you to finish four outfits for me, OK, boys? Hop to it!
This has no pattern yet!!!
What? Do you want to start fresh? 
No
Yes
Now, don't mind me! I'll just give you a little advice while you work. Trust me, you need it.
Very well! Then wait just a moment! Let's Splart anew!
First, go have yourself a drink so you can become a proper Splart water pump!
Once you're able to pump out water like a human fire hydrant...
Your pay will be...
By the way, if you hit two or more Designbombs...
The pattern always ends up being a star! Remember that!!
The Designbomb patterns are...
As soon as I started selling my Splart clothing designs...
I immediately sold out and started getting orders for more!
If you guys have time, I'd like you to make more clothes for me!
If you make me a lot of clothes, I'll make it worth your while!
But this time, I want you guys to make your own designs!
The tropical design...
The polka-dot design...
Good luck!
And the checkered design!
Not bad! Not bad at all!
This is your salary!
Very nice! Very nice indeed! But you've already made clothing with this design. Don't go retro!
Think of a new design!
Want to see all the different clothes you've made? 
No
Yes
With all of these clothes, I can open my own shop! Thank you!
Thank you so much! Please accept this!
Oh! What great timing!
Bahahaha! Less chat and more splat!
OK... I can do this... I CAN do this...
Here goes nothing!
Huh?!
What...was I doing?
Master Iggy! It's...well... kind of a long story.
Allow me to explain.
Yeah, that's probably for the best.
You were looking for Lord Bowser when you fell and hit your head.
Ahhh, is that so? Bahahaha!
It took us a while to find you.
Now that we have, let's start looking for Lord Bowser again.
We'll accompany you, of course.
Huh. I guess I'm double crossing Master Iggy, aren't I?
Is this awkward for you guys? I feel a bit awkward about it...
Bahahahaaa!
Here we goooo!
So, you came to defeat me, eh?
You should've just said so in the first place!
You should know that I'm SUPER DUPER strong!
Yeah... YEAH! Let's look for Lord Bowser!
Master Iggy! It doesn't have to be this way!
Wow. Shy Guy's really got a way with words. And with lies.
I'll have to try that next time. Ya know, playing it cooool.
You recruited Koopaling Iggy!
Are you the ones stirring up trouble here with the mischief and the mayhem?
That miiight have been Master Iggy...
Oh! Pardonne-moi!
I am terribly sorry for casting nasty doubt upon you.
However, this IS a rather sacred place, with the majesty and the magic and all.
To rude guests who stomp about with the dirty feet and the loud voices, I must say...
ADIEU!
Bonjour, monsieurs!
Maybe if you died and were reborn... Hmm... Nope, you'd still never be cool.
This area is closed due to an emergency situation! Stay back, I say!
You received a new recording! Listen to it in the Music player!
AHH! How did THAT happen??? You guys are no slouches!
↑ Yoshi Theater ←↑ Hoohoo Mountain ↓ Beanbean Castle Town
Derr... No matter what you hit me with, you can't knock me down.
I think...
Congratulations!
Excellent job, making it all the way here! Let me commemorate the moment with this! Take it, please!
What's that? You want even more commemoration?
Well! Aren't you the greedy one! No more for you!
You got a Critical Bat!
Hoo Bean
This is where the real challenge starts. Look, you probably should just give up and go home!
You received a new recording! Listen to it in the Music player!
This is a region map. It shows your current location and the location of Save Albums.
If you lose track of where you are, just check your map.
So! The fink-rats come at last!
Send the Beanstar up here!
Oh! Oh, I am laughing at you! I can see through your pathetic designs, you ugly thing!
That was a FAKE Beanstar!
Now you give me the real one!
Har! You idiots of stupidity!
Now is the time when you hand over the Beanstar, you little men!
Send the Beanstar up to the top of this pedestal, and be hasty!
Well, as you know, the Koopa Cruiser exploded in glorious fashion.
Said explosion scattered the Minions all across the Beanbean Kingdom.
It's up to you to find and recruit all of the Minions before making your final stand!
The Skies Above Mushroom Kingdom
*sigh* Let's go save the day or whatever.
Who am I, you ask? I work at the arcade in Little Fungitown.
Don't. Care. Stop. Talking. BYE NOW.
There! Now listen, you! Hand over the beans!
So this is an Invincibility Mushroom! Wow! I've never seen one before!
Thank you! Here, you've really earned these five beans!
Hmph!
You received 5 beans!
Stupid stinky Toads...
That's fair...
That's the way, Cap.
Hmm? What way?
Buddieeees!
Oh, man! I was SO lonely all by myself!
I slipped in among the shells of this kingdom and tried not to stand out.
I was all alone and unknown. Just the thought makes me wanna groan.
Well, your double life is over. Join us and we'll save Lord Bowser together!
Together we are...
YES! I'd love that! I'll do me best. I'll never rest! You'll be impressed.
ALL ALONE?!
But, just so I know... Is fighting in store? Or something more?
You recruited Koopaling Morton!
Well... Yes. There will be lots of fighting.
But can I ask you something? What's with the rhymes?
I mean, I love me some good rhymes, but even I know when to say when.
Well, I've never fought with anyone but Mario, so I'm not too confident.
Actually... I was in charge of cleaning at Bowser's Castle.
Since I'm a lover, not a fighter... rhymes make the mood lighter.
That's sublime! It's always a good time to rhyme! Heh.
Heeey...
I won't stop until I'm the world's greatest Goomba!
Come on, Private Goomp! Join me as my underling!
Soldiers! Over here!
...Isn't that along the lines of something you said earlier?
...
That's cruel! Way too cruel!
You stole my dream and used it against me to inflict emotional damage!
Look. Just go along with it.
Sergeant Guy and Corporal Paraplonk are on our side too.
Riiight. Well, let's move along.
Shut up! SHUT UP!!
Goomp Squad! Initiate Battle Formation Omega!
Should we just...ignore him?
Nah. Let's bring him along.
Th-This time I was... just...underleveled!
I like this "peace" nonsense and that "no fighting" shtick.
I'm glad I spoke up! It's always best to give violence a rest.
Halt! We're here...
There he is! The ruffian!
Hey! Wait your turn, punk!
What's this all about?
Hmmm. You need to work on your communication skills, see?
You simply ain't qualified to be my partner. Amscray, palooka!
And don't come back, ya hear?
Next in line, please!
Master Morton! Please listen!
Hmmm... Ya lack the right look, see? No, ya don't see it. I don't either.
You just ain't qualified for the job. Beat it.
I'M GRABBING TOAD. YOU GUYS SMASH THOSE OTHER GUYS.
Halt!
HEY! It's those rejects from before!
Ha! That settles THAT.
Ah! Private Goomp! You're still alive!
MORTON... ME... I...
What do you think you're doin' in my turf?!
Master Morton is gonna conquer the Toad village up ahead!
You guys are in for a beating if you get in his way!
Parting ways with Corporal Paraplonk and Sergeant Guy got me thinking...
Yeah! We'll use our fireballs to turn you into Minion dust!
Make it five!!
I only see Goombas... Is this a Goomba gala?
Minions fighting Minions... Why, cruel world?
All I want is for us to go and save Lord Bowser together...
You've got a deal! Thanks, buddy!
Heck yeah, it is!
Is that your intimidation pose? It's pretty lame...
We are NOT buddies. And once we're all squared, you'd better beat it!
♪All my Goombas, put your feeeet in the aiiiir!♪
Come on! Let's fight!
Deal! You'll bean it and I'll beat it! Heh!
Just kidding. I simply prefer the company of Goombas.
Pleeease! Help meeee!
Look, up ahead! It's that Toad village Master Morton is trying to conquer...
I have 10 of those beans to spare anyway...
I see. So... Are you still Fawful's underling?
But if we unbrainwash Master Morton, we'll be saving those Toads. Ew.
AHH! MORE Minions?! There goes the neighborhood...
We're ALL Lord Fawful's underlings!
Huh? What's a diabolical Toad doing here?
Ah. Yes. That would be why I said I was sorry.
STOP HIM.
If sayin' "sorry" fixed everything, bein' a master thief would be a lot easier.
GRAB TOAD.
Consider this the final part of the audition!
Master Morton! Snap out of it!
Whichever one of ya can take down these punks...
will have the distinct honor of bein' my new partner!
WHAT? You have GOT to be kidding me!
You guys are really gonna help that stinky Toad?!
Are you all right, darling?
No! Of course not! I promise you, that's not it at all...
It's just that Master Morton was hit by Fawful's evil spray, so...
WHAT HAPPEN TO BOWSER?!
Welp. Back to square one...
Hey! Wait!
Phew! Only three Koopalings left to unbrainwash.
*sigh* Let's go...
We're going to fight the rest of the Koopalings too?!
Lord Bowser... I hope you're OK...
Keeheehee! It's not as hopeless as it sounds.
Even if our power level leaves much to be desired...
If we stick together, there's no enemy we can't overcome!
All of our Minion spirit will gather together...
It will grow our small squad into a giant army!
Acting self-important is very captain-like behavior.
One that can save Lord Bowser!
I better not see your ugly face again!
It is? Oh! I'll work on that...
So, yeah. We'll be fine.
Now then! Let's move out! Follow me!
All of us WILL make it back to Bowser's Castle!
No, wait! That's not accurate. That was from earlier.
But until then, everybody... please give it your all...
I, Private Goomp, have come to a decision!
And that decision is...to... Huh. What did I decide again?
That's enough, Private Goomp. We've HAD this conversation.
You're the one who started it! You must be sooo embarrassed.
Now listen up!
In the beginning, all of this frightened even yours truly...
But now I'm a top-tier super captain, saving Lord Bowser one win at a time!
Private Goomp, you really should just go ahead and join us.
He's complimenting himself again...
Oh. I should?
Oh, I know! You can be a captain too!
That's a surefire way to boost your confidence!
It's the perfect pairing if you're looking for a Goomba team.
Me... Could it be? A captain? Well then!
You'll also get a fancy Bonus Skill.
Yeah... I think...I'll give it a shot!
Oooh... I like fancy...
If I'm a captain, good things will happen!
Wait! You said good time to rhyme! Nice one! Ahahahaha!
Is this guy's head screwed on right?
Let's get crackin'! Or my lips will keep on smackin'!
He's just excited... And hey, this'll lighten things up!
This Koopa Troopa's in charge, livin' large! Best captain around, from sky to ground!
Sure. Whatever.
That thief who was with Lord Bowser should be somewhere around here...
Hopefully Bowser is still with him.
I'll win next time for sure! Mark my words!
Well, we can't just go charging in like we did last time.
Oh, yeah. I'm marking them riiiight now.
Oh? Wow. It seems you've matured a bit.
Hey! Unhand me! This is all so humiliating...
Can't we just talk all night and skip the fight?
You "recruited" Private Goomp!
Ah, who am I kidding? That would NEVER work.
Ohhhh, what will I doooo...
Oooooh. I think I love that plan.
Ya know... If you go get it for me, I'll give you an amazing bean...
If we talk it out with Lord Bowser, I'm sure we can clear the air!
A precious, priceless bean that will raise your EXP!
Ah! Koopa Troopas!
That wasn't a plan. He was just babbling, like YOU do.
With that, you'd be able to level up easy as pie...
Hey! Ouch!
Don't be silly! It's a fine plan! The peaceful route...
It's just crazy enough to work! YEAH! No fighting whatsoever!
Stop following us, stop bribing us, and just generally leave us alone!
I came here to score some exciting new prizes.
What are you doing?!
Ooh, deal! I accept your condition! Does that mean you'll get it for me?
The rare Invincibility Mushroom can be found in a cave up ahead...
Those aren't Koopa Troopas, Cap.
I think they're this kingdom's version of Koopa Troopas.
...How many of those amazing beans will you give me if I do this?
That's the prize I want, but that cave is too scary...
Ah. I see.
Hm? Looks like there's something growing on their heads...
Hi. Hello. Um. Sorry about last time. By the way, is Lord Bowser with you?
I'll double my offer. Two beans!
This Koopa Troopa fake is a real flake—make no mistake!
You don't sound sorry at all!
No way! Gimme seven!
Heh. See what I did there?
I rhymed stuff with other stuff.
Who's this "Lord Bowser" anyhow? Ya mean that big lunk, Rookie?
YIKES!! I mean... Erm... Thanks for...rescuing me?
I'm, um...safe now. Thanks to...you?
Three! Final offer!
Well, at least I amuse myself...
That slippery slug disappeared along with the Beanstar. Good riddance!
Huh? Oh, right. The Toad.
Just so you know, we didn't do it to help you! Not by a long shot!
We don't need your smelly gratitude either, so scram!
Captain Goomba, I must insist that you stop that. Immediately.
Oh. So Lord Bowser isn't here, after all...
*whistles* Big talk, Cap. You sure showed that Toad who's boss.
Welp, team... Time to march onward!
Geez. I don't even know how to feel right now.
Hey! Hold it, ya hear?!
Yeaaaah... That doesn't sit well with me.
I know what you mean. Toads are despicable!
They defy Lord Bowser! They help stupid Mario and stupider Luigi!
I HATE THEM! SO MUCH! EVERY LAST ONE OF 'EM!
I gotta pay ya back for last time, see?
Just remember. We're doing this to save Lord Bowser!
Um...
Pay us...back?
Yeah! It's all for Bowser! Those goobery Toads have nothing to do with it!
What do you want?! We're busy here!
If you have some business with us, spit it out in three seconds or less!
Yeah, the whole "being ambushed outta the stinkin' blue" thing? Remember that?
Don't even try to deny it! It was uncalled for, see?!
HP fully restored! BP fully restored!
You boys wanna ride in the cart again? 
No
Yes
Explain
You lookin' to ride again? 
No
Yes
Whoa there, pards! It's been a Goomba's age since we had any strangers in these parts!
Now listen, fellers: if you want to ride in them rusty old carts, I won't go a-stoppin' you.
But I'd advise watchin' out fer trouble. Yep. No one knows where them rails lead...
Still, I'll tell you somethin': you might just be able to find jewels by jumpin' a bit in there.
And while you're hoppin' for loot, watch out! If you spot danger, just shine your light at it!
...Oh, mercy! There I go again! I'm always borin' folks to tears with stuff like this...
You gonna walk on by without ridin'? 
No
Yes
Hmph! You fellers ain't my problem.
So, erm... Tell me, boys...
Care to ride in the carts? 
No 
Yes 
Explain
Sniiiiiiff...
Snort... Snort...
Ruff! Ruff!
Gotcha! So...
Then happy trails, fellers!
Go on, try your best! It won't be enough.
Bwahaha! There's no way you'll beat me!
If you're in the middle of a fight and blank on how to use those Hammers...
You'll find the instructions written in the guide on the bottom screen!
Are you ready to learn? 
No
Yes
Hey! We're goin' back so we can ride the cart again!
I'm sure you guys'll be able to take care of business!
If you can't, you're gonna have to give us those Hammers back!
Yeah! Cart rides are thrillin' and filled with suspenders!
You nitwit! It's "filled with suspense!" SUSPENSE!!!
Oops! Well, excuuuuse me!
You don't HAVE to ask us for our infinite Hammer wisdom, but... 
Awkward silence
Ask
Sometimes I can't help wonderin' why we're even here...
As long as you've got Hammers, we're kind of...redundant. SIGH.
Oh, cruel world... So full of cruelocity...
Wait up!
We forgot to mention one thing!
We never taught you how to use your Hammers in battle!
んな 
つめ

てぇコト

言
うなよ…
Then we'll explain it... in battle!
Didja get all that? You better have!
You better look alive with those things. There are a lot of monsters that your jump won't do diddly to!
You gotta learn some new tricks if you wanna get by 'em!
You know what? FINE. If you don't want to hear our infinite Hammer wisdom, we're outta here...
I looked up to the sky when I heard a voice from above.
Some tiny fella was flying around holding that big guy.
It seemed like they were arguing about something.
Then the tiny fella dropped the big guy.
Ah! It's this one!
This one looks coolest!
OK. We grabbed the Mushrooms in the deepest part of the cave...
Hrm... But how do we know which of these is the Invincibility Mushroom?
Why don't you do a taste test?
No way! I refuse to eat anything that awful Mario enjoys!
Hmm...
Uh, well, hey there, fellas. I'm the famous starfish star, Spangle... I'm, uh, pleased to meetcha.
You got a Spangle?!?
Whoa, now! I tell ya, since I first came here 365 days ago...
I ain't seen a soul! Y'all are the first folks I've seen!
Uh, lemme tell ya... Even a star from way over that big ol' sea...
...needs a stage to stand on. Unh! Yeah! That's right, baby!
Now, uh, tell me, fellas... Don't ya'll know a place that'd suit a shinin' star like me? C'mon, now!
Yeah... That's right... A place for a shinin' star like me... Like the top of a festive tree!
Uh, what's that, now?!? You know just the place? Well, hot dog, baby! I'm ready to rock 'n' roll!
Uh, say, fellas... Looks like you got yourselves a big ol' suitcase...
How 'bout you let me crash in that thang, baby?
You boys wanna ride in the cart again? 
No
Yes
Explain
You lookin' to ride again? 
No
Yes
Eh?! Hrm? Why, howdy! ...Again.
Well, fellers, this spot marks the last stop on the long, strange railroad ride of my life.
...But I reckon your adventure has just begun. Get to it, boys!
Well, all right, then...
Eh?! Hrm? Oh, right! Here, take this.
You gonna walk on by without ridin'? 
No
Yes
It's also mighty nice to listen to some tunes if you're tired from yer journey.
You'll find cassette tapes scattered all about in different places...
Some fellers even like to collect those tunes!
Anyhow... Take care.
Hmph! You fellers ain't my problem.
You received a new recording! Listen to it in the Music player!
So, erm... Tell me, boys...
Care to ride in the carts? 
No 
Yes 
Explain
Sniiiiiiff...
Snort... Snort...
Ruff! Ruff!
Then happy trails, fellers!
Congratulations!
Excellent job, making it all the way here! Let me commemorate the moment with this! Take it, please!
What's that? You want even more commemoration?
Well! Aren't you the greedy one! No more for you!

MINIONS AND TOADS DO WHAT MORTON TELLS THEM.
BAHAHAHAHA.
THIS IS MORTON'S TOWN NOW. LORD FAWFUL'S TOWN TOO.
Master Morton!
A band of Minions led by a Goomba is closing in on us!
SMART MINIONS JOIN ME. DUMMIES GET BEAT UP.
Sir, yes, sir!
I am Thwomp, and I love a good game! Test your luck for a mere  coins!
Are you guys ready to show me the mightiest swing you've got? 
No
Yes
You don't have enough coins!!!
Break any one of these that you like with your Hammer.
If you're lucky, you'll get yourself one incredible treasure!
You got  coins!
You got Secret Scroll 1!
Too bad!
Scram! Get out of here! Scram before I crush you!
You can now use a new Bros. Attack in battle!
↑ Gwarhar Lagoon
Only then shall you shoot forth a mighty blast of flame!
Perhaps you should try it once.
Yes... It is all coming back... I have been waiting for you. You want the Hand Power, right?
You want to master the fiery Hand Power known as the Firebrand, do you not?
You do, right? Right? RIGHT? You do not need to tell me. Your pose says it all.
I see no problem with your skill.
If you just do this action near something flammable, you should have no problems!
Surely this skill will open new paths in your life! Wouldn't you agree?
Don't worry... I only pretend to be dead. Ha ha funny.
I think I am myself, reborn!

Oh, waiting just burns me UP! But enough about that...

So... FAREWELL!

I have been waiting for you. I have waited many long years, smoldering like embers.
Huh? You, uh... This place...
Umm... This place of power...
It is, uh... This place is...
Now, wait a second... Just what kind of place was this, anyway?
What was it that I was planning on doing? Am I allowed in here?
Huh? Wait just a minute! Where am I? WHO am I???
...Hm! I guess having no guests for 3000 years takes a toll. Everything just seems to...
slip one's mind!
Har diddy HAR! How humorous! So! I guess you can do what you want! I won't stop you!
Oh! Wait! I just remembered!
This is the famed Fire Palace, where we teach the ways of the blistering Hand Power!

What you do if you meet big Firebrand in room up ahead??? Huh? What you do?
Hey, Greenie! Time to get pummeled!
Bahaha! Perfect! This is where we'll build my fortress!
And then we'll take over that village over there... This is gonna be great!
Master Larry...sure is powerful. That's a lot of power for one guy.
Well, he IS a Koopaling. What did you expect?
Master Larry! Where shall I place this?
Hmm... Over there!
Master Larry! Please join us!
We're going to rescue Lord Bowser!
That won't work for me. The thought of obeying a Goomba makes me sick.
But, Master Larry! You can take over as captain, really!
All I care about is saving Lord Bowser!
Hmm. You're serious about this, aren't you?
I suppose I'll allow you the pleasure of my company. But you'll need a plan...
We're going to gather all of the missing Minions...
Rescue Lord Bowser...and return home to the Mushroom Kingdom!
Master Larry! Where should I make the entrance?
Hmm... Right there!
Huh? Hey! Goomba and Shy Guy!
What are you doing?! Get back to work!
H-Here goes nothing!
BAHAHA! You wanna fight me?! You're pretty bold for a Goomba!
Bahahaha! It cracks me up when you talk all serious like that.
Well, Iggy's in the forest, and Morton's near the valley. Wendy took the sea.
I only know about those three. I lost track of Roy, Ludwig, and Lemmy.
Thanks, Master Larry! The forest, the valley, and the sea! Let's go!
You should know I don't intend to try very hard.
Also, I'm not gonna be captain. Seems like a lot of hassle.
You recruited Koopaling Larry!
HMMM...

Wh-Who dares to touch the great Thunderhand spark?!? Impertinent fool!
...And yet... You have touched the great Thunderhand spark, but still stand before me, so...
...Perhaps you have the qualities needed to master the galvanic Thunderhand technique...
Very well... I shall instruct you in the art of the Thunderhand.
Only then shall you release a burst of thunder and lightning.
Perhaps you should try it once.
Don't worry... I only pretend to be dead. Ha ha funny.

Lakitu!
SHHH! If we're found out, it's curtains for us!
Huh? Curtains?
Look, you can't go to that village!
But that's where the weirdo who kidnapped Lord Bowser is!
He might be brainwashing our poor king this very moment!
We've gotta go rescue him!
Sure, but we won't stand much of a chance as we are now.
Yep. Just a small-time Goomba gang.
How could you...
Just leave it to me, yeah?
What do you mean?
As for me, I'll scout out where the others are for you.
That way you can go and recruit them all. How's that sound?
OK... I think I understand.
Come on, let's hurry...
Whaaaa?!
Heh, I overheard some good stuff back there!
Forget that goofy Goomba. You work for me now, Lakitu!
I'm putting together an army for the great Lord Fawful!
Hey, hey!
Rookie! Put a little more oomph into it, will ya? Polish things up!

So? Are your hat and clothes a striking shade of red? They are!
Should your eyes still be closed? No, they shouldn't.
Greetings! Are you here for my hypnotic powers? Undoubtedly.
Hmm, but why do you look so... horrified? You don't even know.
Take a nice, deep breath. Did you breathe in? Yes, now breathe out.
Are you more relaxed now? Of course you are.
By the way, are you dressed up as the hero, Mario? Yes, clearly so.
Are you perhaps obsessed with the jumpy superstar? Surely.
Can I ease your sad psychosis by helping you BECOME Mario? I can!
Do you believe you are the one and only Mario? Yes, you do!
Who's the guy with the red hat and miscolored 'stache? You are!
Who stomps evildoers with the grace of an acrobat? You do!
Who's the shining superstar of the Mushroom Kingdom? That's YOU!
Are you feeling like Mario yet? Yes, you certainly are!
Are you becoming Mario? ...Yes!
Are your thoughts Mario-like? ...Yes!
Are you more Mario? Much more!
Are you very much Mario? Very much!
Are you mostly Mario? Certainly!
AWAKEN!!!
Now! Join me over here...
Are you all Mario now?! Yes! You're Mario!!!
Are you becoming more and more mushroomy? You are!
Are you becoming a Toad... Yes! Quite Toady!
I am ALREADY a Toad!
Ha! See that? You must! Are you Mario now? Most completely!
Are you the most easily hypnotized person ever? It would seem so...
Who's the greatest... I am! Who's a genius... I AM!
Dr. Toadley has at last attempted to hypnotize himself.
Just close your eyes and be soothed by my soothing voice...
Yep! It sank. An', uh, time passed an' passed, an' before anyone knew it, the ocean was a desert!
In fact, it's been so dang long, jus' lookit us! We're jus' bags of bones over here!
Eh? Whuzzat? You wanna know why this ship is in a desert? Oh! That's 'cause, uh...
See, this is a sunken ship, ya know? It uh... It used to float. An' then, well...
Bluh?!? Wha's goin' on here?!?
C-Cap'n! It's the ocean! It's an actual ocean!
Oh! Is the S.S. Chuckola finally afloat once more???
Hoo Bean
There he is! Fawful!!
Give us our Lord Bowser back!
As a botanist, I must say I am quite interested in these Piranha Plants, loathsome as they may be.
Water can be easily extracted from the petals of the Piranha Plant. Did you know that? It's true.
The plants are said to hide below- ground so as not to be shocked by lightning when wet.
However! Now is the time of following.
He displays trustings and friendship toward you three right now.
Have maximum secrecy so my new plan of genius remains unknown to Goomba!
Hmph.
Hmm. Nothing here really seems like it will do the trick...
Phooey! What about you guys? Any luck?
All I see is snow. Oh! And ice.
Right. Well, let's keep looking...
You saw through my clever disguise! Yes, it is I! Private Goomp!
Sergeant Guy! Corporal Paraplonk! Let's destroy these insolent Minions!
Okeydoke!
Private Goomp! Sergeant Guy! Corporal Paraplonk! Let's DO this!
Battle Formation Hyperdrive, GOOO!
What am I... Huh...
Master Roy! Are you back to normal now?!
We did it! I think we have enough stuff here to get the job done.
I dunno what happened... Why was I following Fawful's orders...
It sounds weird, but I really can't explain it...
Hm? What's that sound?
Yeaaah. This is bad.
It was definitely somewhere around here... I think...
Ah! Yes! Over there!
But let's get one thing straight!
This doesn't mean I respect you or anything like that.
If you want my respect, you gotta earn it. To do that, no matter what happens...
Promise me you'll save Lord Bowser and all of his Minions!
Roger! We won't let you down!
You recruited Koopaling Roy!
I'll make a name for myself... be famous...swim in a pool of coins...
I'll be able to do whatever I want... eat my dessert BEFORE dinner...
AHHH!
Um, Private Goomp...
That goofy Goomba took down Morton and Wendy?! BAHAHA!
No... That's not my name. My name is...Bob...Om.
Do not have underestimations, underling! My spray was without effect on him...
He must be a Goomba of slightly above-average brain havings!
Sure it is. Now can you please stop that bomb?
Hmph! No way. A Goomba is a Goomba is a Goomba.
They're just a bunch o' scrawny runts!
You know what? Forget it. I know how this ends. Let's get right to fighting.
Whoever loses has to do whatever the winner says, deal?
That's the prize you always insist on, Private Goomp. So let's have at it.
If I get my hands on that glorified mushroom, it'll be over in one punch!
I must be returning to my castle of shiny newness for placement of Fawful statues!
You can have the dealing with of these fink-rats!
Gladly! I'll stomp these fink-whatevers along with their stupid loser cruiser!
Bahahahaha!!
I am still keeping another card in the sleeve where I keep such cards...
It is you who will be the ones to deliver the blow of finality!
Hmph. Why are we doing this in such a cowardly way?
Is it really OK for us to take all this? ...Hello? You CAN hear me, right?
Goomba... No matter how many smashings I smash him with, he keeps coming back!
I must crush him with the most thorough of thoroughest crushings!!
Oh, thank you! I think I'm the best-looking one here too.
Hm? You respect me as a friend AND as a superior ally? You're too kind!
And if this plan works... Say that part again...
You shouldn't dote on me so! No, no, I don't deserve such praise...
What's that? You really enjoy my company, and especially my rhymes?
Hey, wait! Forget I said anything. You already have, haven't you?
Hey! Where are Goomp and Guy? And where's Paraplonk?!
The Trio? They're right... Um... That's weird...
Oooh... I think we can use this...
HEY! Private Goomp! Sergeant Guy! Corporal Paraplonk!!
Where'd they go?!
Wait! Master Roy! Where are you going?!
Those three are setting a time bomb right now.
WHAT? Really?!
Listen up, Goon Squad.
Bowser's Minions are in deep trouble.
Looks like I've got no choice but to dig you losers out of it!
Ah... Well, that's nice.
If we have the glory of success and the victory dances, you will have rewarding.
You will be commanders of eliteness over Cackletta's Mighty Minions!
Commanders... Heh, cool.
Whatever you are wanting will be yours for the having!
Your most favorite of yum snacks and the music that is to your liking!
Anything and everything of your wantingness will be yours!
Anything and everything... That sounds pretty good.

Splart Assistant Inquire Within ...Ask for Harhall
YAAARF!
Im-Impossible! No WAY am I working with explosive colors like those!
Burrrr-urrrrp! Water... Drank...too much water...
A bean-like thing that cascaded down from the heavens! Tah-dah!
See! Here is the bean-like thing I promised you! Take it with you!!
Still a ways to go!
Halfway there!
Only one left to go!
You got a Beanstar piece!
Only  more to go!
Ah, nice work!
You guys are incredible!
If I need help again, I'll be coming to you!
You got a piece of the Beanstar!
Now you have all four pieces!
Hurry! Back to Beanbean Castle!
Us Shy Guys, for example, excel when matched against Lakitus and Lakipeas.
WHAT?! You're not going to tell me the answer?
Victory! Now let's get out of this crazy place. We need to...huh?
Watch out! Behind you! It's a well-timed enemy!
You can find more details on all this in the Formation menu.
Study the guide and practice. Learn who's strong against who.
He's watching... That's just creepy. Is he going to follow us or what?
Ooh, nice critical hit!
...HEY! Look over there!
What's THAT, little buddy? You see that?! 
It's some sorta yummy-looking flying bean man! MMM, good!
...Th-This will be fine. Juuust fine. Probably.
You recruited Fire Stalking Piranha Plant!
Yes, you are clearly a Goomba from the Mushroom Kingdom!
In our fair land, your kind are nearly as famous as the brothers Mario.
Ahem... That only happened because Sergeant Guy's squad is weak!
We'll call this round a draw!
We'll postpone the next round until Sergeant Guy's squad is stronger!
MY squad? You think MY SQUAD was the problem?!
The Goomp Squad just charged forward without thinking!
Honestly, the Paraplonk Squad carried the dead weight of BOTH your squads.
You just fluttered around!
I think...NOW we should ignore them.
Hey! What happened?! I can't see a thing!
Yeah. I think you're right...
What are you TALKING about?!
Keep your lousy magic away from me!
My words will be spoken with the bluntness of a knife for buttering!
Baha...haha...
You recruited Lakitu! 
Bowser's Castle belongs to Fawful now!!
HAH!
I had knowings that the Koopalings would not go down so easily...
WHAT?! No way!
You took over Bowser's Castle?! No... Y-You're lying!
Now is the happening of Plan B!!
Your belief is as necessary as shaving cream to a hairless monkey!
Time for max-strength spray! Your brains will be washed with 99.9% effectiveness!
Hey! Stop playing it cool and help me out here!
It is most easy to conquer a castle that is full of emptiness!
Aaaaahhhhh!
Hmph!
Th-Those Piranha Plants are fellow Minions!
I hear there are tons of Boos in a nearby cave...
What kind of army of stupid havings leaves their castle without guarding?!
Noooooooo!!
Master Larry! Don't leave us!
Youch, those teeth were SHARP. Good thing I'm so hardheaded.
Oh... Um... There's a good reason for that! It's just...a secret.
...
I'm afraid the Koopalings are on Fawful's side...
Guess you were telling the truth. You're not very tasty.
So the Minions... They ALL came along for this mission?
It is a thing of amazement! So, Koopalings seven...
How are you finding my spray of delicious wickedness?
Wanna try frying him? And track down some aioli?
I dunno. I just go where I'm told and attack mustachioed dudes.
Looks like. Master Larry was saying the strangest things...
He was all "Lord Fawful" this and "fink-rat" that.
Stop that! Some things aren't funny. Like MUTINY!
Yes, it's settled! You're coming with us!
No... How could this happen...
It's safer to go as a group than to go it alone.
Uh, sure. I'm fine with that.
Wow. That was easier than expected.
Hooray! I got another ally! Let's try our best, OK?
So that flag... Does that mean you're in charge? Or just that you're fancy?
Hey! Your formation looks awfully similar to ours too! That's low!
It does! The first one, I mean. I'm the captain of this squad.
It's really not similar at all...
Emergency! Code red! MAYDAY!!
Wait! STOP!!
Huh. I can see your aura.
Quiet, Goomba Squad! Prepare to battle the Goomp Squad!
Whoever loses has to surrender and bow down to the winner!
Calm down, soldier! Did you find Lord Bowser?!
Lord Bowser...is gone?
Oh? You can see it too?
I wasn't sure at first, but I guess I really do have what it takes!
Umm... Why don't we all just work together and be friends?
N-No. I haven't found Lord Bowser yet. But...
What...does that mean? Where'd he go?
Huzzah! One of our own! Are you OK, soldier?
That's the finest aura of stupidity I've ever seen.
Unacceptable! I will recruit ALL of the Minions and make a name for myself!
Nothing good can come of blurring the line between leader and subordinate!
I don't know, but I aim to find out. Quickly! To the Koopa Cruiser!
I DID find the Koopa Cruiser!
What in Bowser's name?!
Sergeant Guy! Corporal Paraplonk!
We'll take the Koopa Cruiser to Bowser's Castle and fix all of this!
Wait. Didn't the Koopa Cruiser blow up? I'm pretty sure it did.
What are you doing?! Don't tell me Fawful brainwashed you too...
We're on it!
Without warning, the plot thickens...
I don't know why the Koopa Cruiser is back, but it is!
Wait... We're on the same side?
Battle Formation Alpha!
Captain Goomba and the other Minions never dreamed their beloved home, Bowser's Castle, could be taken over...
You have to believe me! Just go scope it out, OK?
It will undoubtedly help us in our search for Lord Bowser.
And maybe it will even help us fly back home to Bowser's Castle!
Phew! Thank goodness. You're not brainwashed after all. Just slow.
I could have sworn I saw a Stalking Piranha Plant here...
Should we just ignore him?
And what's this nonsense about Lord Bowser no longer being "a thing that is of this world"?
Your plan is a stupid plan full of grubby grub holes!
You should know whose side someone's on before throwing turnips at them!
Blargh! There's no one here!
I'd feel better if we recruited some more Minions soon.
We can't. Those three are high-ranking Minions...
Let's win this and recruit them!
If things continue down this path, the Minions will have no home to return to, and no king to serve...
There is no home for you to be having. Your home-having plans are for naught!
Listen, jerk. The Minions are acting crazy. They've been attacking me!
That's why I turnip any Minion I run into, no questions asked.
Hey, you! Hold on a minute!
With heavy hearts, Captain Goomba and his Minions rushed to the Koopa Cruiser, their minds racing with worrisome thoughts...
I...see where you're coming from.
(It's a good thing I'm a master dodger.)
Heh heh heh! Greetings, friend! I see you are not a talking rock after all.
Oh. Right. I know these things.
OK, so our first order of business is to un-brainwash our fellow Minions.
What? Really? Heehee... I could get used to this.
If the captain is weak, the entire squad is weak as well.
Indeed! Goombas are famously the first ones Mario always stomps!
Ah... I suppose that's true.
Wow... That one hurt. I guess I can't be mad at the truth, though.
Anyway. Smug guy! Have you seen any Piranha Plants around here?
W-Wait!
Learn this stuff on your own and your skills will improve.
I cannot say that I have, as that would be an untruth!
As it were, I haven't time to chat.
Forgive my manners. I must away now! May we meet again!
Oh! Private Goomp! Thank goodness you're safe!
...Hey! Wait just a minute!
What in the... He's rather rude for such a fancy fellow.
Goomba! I've done a lot of thinking since I was under Fawful's control...
And I've come to a decision!
Hey, Cap! I found Master Larry! He's got lots of Minions with him!
You recruited Shy Guy! You can now make Shy Guy your captain.
HEY! You two! Over here!
Excellent! Let's get going!
What happens now?
Sergeant Guy and Corporal Paraplonk! Are you guys...out for a stroll?
Do I have to tell you everything? Come on. Let's push forward.
Yes, we're going to sing and dance and have a nice picnic.♪
NOT! What are you, a moron?!
Oh. So I guess you're all Fawful's underlings, then?
Wrong again! We are LORD Fawful's very topmost underlings!
Lord Bowser? Kidnapped? Don't be ridiculous!
Ya wouldn't think it, but he's got a naive side.
Just sayin' it's possible he's bein' conned or somethin'.
Bahahaha!
I thought we'd stand a chance against Fawful with the Koopalings on our side...
I never dreamed they'd join the enemy!
You looking for trouble, buddy?
It's OK! I've got an idea! We'll beat the Koopalings...
Knock the washing from their brains and recruit them to our side!
Ah... Ahem...
You say that like it's so simple and achievable...
I was just on my way out. My sincerest apologies!
I'm not sure how yet...
But we'll have to become even stronger than the Koopalings!
Well, looks like we have no choice but to find them ourselves.
In any case, there's no point arguing until we catch sight of Lord Bowser.
We'll just have to split up and keep searching...
So...what do you think?
Piranha Plant! Oh, PIRANHA PLANT! Where are youuuuu?!
That is as pointless as dulled pencils used for letters to nobodies!
I don't...entirely hate the idea.
Piranha...Plant?
Are you idiots deaf or something? Get lost before we—
Yeah! Acting without thinking! That's the Minion way!
Arghhhhh!
Hah and hah again!
It is my having of luck that caused our meeting here!
The Koopalings seven! It is I who am the king of you now!
Now! Have the saying of my name!
Let's follow Captain Goomba's plan. It's our only hope!
As for me, I'll go and scout out the other Minions.
W-Wait! I'll be the first to admit I look a bit like a muffin, but...
I taste like yuck! No amount of frying or aioli would make a difference!
We're counting on you, Lakitu!
Mmm... Deep frying and aioli... That actually sounds really good.
Defeat the Koopalings to recruit them, and then go rescue Lord Bowser!
The Minions are determined to stand up to a powerful foe they've never faced before. Will they succeed? Only time will tell...
I mean! That's not the point!
Please! Let me goooo!!
Hmm. You're different from the Piranha Plants we have at home.
Yeah, this must be a variety that's native to the Beanbean Kingdom.
NO! Wait... That's wrong too... That's from when my brain was fuzzy.
All... Lor...
Um, so what decision did you come to?
Wow. That's a skosh demoralizing.
Our castle was taken. We're all quite shaken.
All hail Lord Fawful!
Oh, right! I, Private Goomp, have made up my mind!
Your rhyming is unspecial and full of cringe! Now is the time of good-bye!
Ah! The ringings of that sound are as sweet as particularly sticky treats!
What was it I decided...?
Hey! You stop right there! Apologize to my friend!
But that Goomba... I am wanting to wash his brain even more than the Koopalings!
I suppose I will have forgettings of him for the time that is now...
To gather all the Minions!
It's OK, Cap. There really wasn't much to it...
That's SO rude. Let's teach these freaks some manners!
And rescue Lord Bowser!
"Taken" and "shaken"! Get it?! It was a delightful rhyme!
That's right! And to score a big, fat compliment from Lord Bowser!
Hah! I have one more sprinkle for your cupcake of despair!
Oh, really? You care about Lord Bowser again?
The Lord Bowser that you have such loooove for...
Did ya find him?
What? Really?!
He is no longer a thing that is of this world!
Nope. Can't find him anywhere!
So...you heard my idea somewhere and decided to copy me! Devious!
WHAT?!
How 'bout you?
You can't mean...
Don't you think I would have said something if I'd found him?
Hmph!
Hey! That's not nice!
We're the almighty Koopalings! How is this happening...
If we don't do something quick, we'll be laughing stocks!
I know. I'll be the captain too. It's a bad idea for you to be the only one.
What are you freaks doing here?! This is OUR turf! Buzz off!
What?! We're going to have TWO captains? That's silly...
We've looked all over and haven't found squat...
Does that mean Lord Bowser was kidnapped?!
Do you know about the Power Triangle?
Hey! Don't you dare ignore us!
Huh? Yeah... I basically wrote the basics on it.
Right. Have you also memorized who's strong against who?
Well, we seem to share the same mission of rescuing our king.
What? Is that different from the Power Triangle? Gimme a minute...
Certain Minions are stronger against certain opponents.
Whoa. That sounds useful.
That's what I thought. Well, let's get going.
Don't worry... I only pretend to be dead. Ha ha funny.
I think I am myself, reborn!
Eebity-eh-eh-eccch!
You took my experience points!
Eebity eebity...
Eebity eebity eebity eebity eebity eebity eebity eebity eebity eebity eebity BLEEB!!!
...I tired...
This Thunder Palace. That way Fire Palace.
L-L-Luigi!!
P-P-Princess Peach!!! She—!!!
Excuse me? Bowser??? Oh, I think you're sorely mistaken.
I'm...
Bowletta!!!
Cackletta's power has poured into this Koopa who is king!!!
The body is of the Bowser, but the mind is all of the Great Cackletta!
I need no voice this time...
I'll just steal...
the real deal!!!
Luigi!!!
                                                                     
   
L-Luigi! Quickly! You must go to your brother, Mario!
Luigi! Are you going somewhere?!
Eeeyah ha ha ha ha!
Fooooools!!!
Whaaaaaaaat!
What're you kicking that for? That's a really rare stone! It's called a Hoohoo Block!
And I'll tell you, anyone who tries to kick a Hoohoo Block down the mountain is a thief in my book!
Huh? My name? Oh... Right! I'm called Blablanadon!
...Whuzzat? The townsfolk are all worried about me? Really? But I didn't mean to make them worry!
See, what happened is this: I saw Prince Peasley and followed him up here...
And then I saw that this huge egg had appeared! I was shocked! I was speechless! Which is rare!
So anyway, I've just been here keeping this poor egg warm ever since! Yup, that's the deal.
I think something will hatch out of it pretty soon! That's what happens with eggs!
Oh! It's here! It's time! Oh, wow! It's about to hatch! I can't take the suspense!
Goo-gwaaaa!
Ack! Well, THAT'S a shock! Talk about one crazy egg!
Cheers to your mustaches!
Th-This incredibly dazzling man is none other than Prince Peasley!!! What happened to you?!?
Well! I suppose you could call it a bit of an accident.
As I was investigating events throughout the country for this top secret mission I'm on...
I suddenly encountered Cackletta and her vile underling, Fawful, here on this mountain...
But by the time I realized who the fiends were, it was too late...
HP fully restored! BP fully restored!
They transformed me into THAT and shut me inside the egg.
Heh heh heh!
Is that so? Princess Peach's voice has been stolen?
Heh heh heh... I wouldn't worry about Princess Peach. I'm quite sure she'll be fine.
At any rate, we should chase after Cackletta!
I want you to visit Queen Bean in Beanbean Castle once you climb down the mountain.
It may be that Cackletta's next target is in Beanbean Castle! I'd bet my life on it!
Oh! Heh heh heh... Here's a gift from me. Autographed, of course!
Heh heh heh... Yes, I think a rose matches your green perfectly!
If you show that rose at Beanbean Castle, they'll permit you to enter!
And with that, I must get back to my mission!
May we meet again!

Hello! Did you guys find anything good?
Nope. In fact, nothing noteworthy happened at all.
Also... What are you doing?
Phew! What a ruckus.
A vacation? Now?
Soon we'll be able to go home, back to Bowser's Castle...
That's right!
We did it! IT'S DONE! The Koopa Cruiser is finally back to normal!
But first we need to take out that Fawful jerk!
I got you jerks a one-way ticket to Painsville! HA!
Gimme a break... There was no need to make it look brand spankin' new.
It just needed to fly!
And you know, I must say...
Goomba really came through and turned out to be a great captain.
Sorry, no refunds! Bahaha!
Sure, but when Lord Bowser gets a look at his glorious Koopa Cruiser...
I bet it'll make him really happy!
That's because his Goomba feet can take the heat!
If a captain can't run, he'll have no fun!
The flight will...have turbulence...uhhh... Whatever! I'm gonna hurt you now!!
That's right! Heeheeee! It'll be amazing.
He's a real... Yeah... I'm being ignored. I'm wasting my best material here.
Time to take off!
Bahaha! Thanks for fixing this thing up for me, losers!
I'll be sure to give you runts exactly what you deserve!
But you must be tuckered out after all that work. How about a little vacation?
Heehee! I'm polishing the floors!
Lord Bowser won't be satisfied unless this ship is PERFECT.
We have to make it look just like our old Koopa Cruiser...
That means it has to be nice and shiny!
Oooh! Amazing! Just what I'd expect from our Chief of Cleaning!
He always had it in him, right from the beginning.
What?! You can't be serious!
He reminds me of Lord Bowser.
Are you FEELING all right? Maybe you should lie down.
Launch preparations are complete! We're good to go!
You received a new recording! Listen to it in the Music player!

Welcome to my item shop. Despite our current appearances, I assure you we have everything you need!
Let's show the world what Goombas are capable of! For Lord Bowser!
Oh, that. Sure.
Private Goomp, Sergeant Guy, and Corporal Paraplonk rejoined your squad!
A few hours ago, aboard the Koopa Cruiser...
Well, as you know, the Koopa Cruiser exploded in glorious fashion.
Said explosion scattered the Minions all across the Beanbean Kingdom.
It's up to you to find and recruit all of the Minions before making your final stand!
Luigi! Are you OK?
What? You don't know what you've been doing?
Don't you remember?
I heard you went to Guffawha Ruins to get Crabbie Grass for Mario...
Did... Did you really get Crabbie Grass?
It-It really IS Crabbie Grass!
Going to the frightful and dangerous Guffawha Ruins all by yourself...
Luigi! How incredibly courageous you are!
Surely you will be a legend in this town!
By the way, what do you think that thunderous noise was?
Could something have happened at the embassy?
Luigi, shouldn't you be rushing to Mario's side?
Invince! Invince! Invince! Invincibility Mushroom!

Trust me on this. You might get sick from foods your body isn't used to! And then things get ugly.
But a delicate fellow like me...
I get sick eating normal foods that I eat all the time! Pity me!
An Invincibility Mushroom, you say? I wonder if it tastes good?
If I eat an Invincibility Mushroom... maybe it'll pump up my muscles...
I wonder if my birthmarks and freckles will go away...
The Mushroom Embassy is just up ahead.
Maybe I'll have him hypnotize me into being younger...

Well, I hope you will continue to frequent my fine cafe.
I'm always happy to have friends partake of the fine flavors produced by my Beanbean Machine.
Heeeeeeeeeee!
Oooh, mercy! Yet another fragrantly rich aroma!
With this, now I can go anywhere I want with ease.
Oh! Professor Gadd!
We just now added this new drink to our menu!
What great timing on your part!
Mmmm... My body and soul are melting into the syrupy sweetness!
I'd better not drink more or else I, too, might become a ghost.
It's not timing that brought me here. No sirree!
The scent of that new drink drew me in. Yep! From over the hills and across the sea, I came walking.
What shall I invent next?
Wow! That's some nose you've got!
Oh? That noise! Not ghosts again?
Now then, might I have a quick sampling of this new drink?
...No, no! This time I've chosen a slightly different way of making my entrance.
Hmm? What? Well, just showing up the same way over and over gets old after a while.
Besides, don't video conferences feel futuristic and cool?
So, you're not going to try out our new drink this time, Boss?
Oh, don't worry!
I've sent a representative to taste it in my stead!
He should be arriving soon.
A representative?
Don't worry. He's a harmless, friendly little ghost.
Please allow him to taste that new drink...
Next time I'll come in person.
Hiya, Boss! But weren't you supposed to be here in person this time?
Promises are made to be broken. I'm too busy with my research.
Hey! This is the famed Starbeans Cafe that everyone's abuzz about! Got any complaints? Compliments?
D-Don't tell me you're sending another representative!
Now, you already know about our special StarB System, right? 
Yes
No
See ya
Righto! Then listen up good as I explain it to you...
The StarB System was created by Starbeans Cafe to expand our menu when you bring us beans!
Here's the deal: get rare beans by digging or battling or playing mini-games, then bring 'em here.
When you bring us new kinds of beans, we add 'em to our menu. And nefariously patent them.
By the way, at the moment, I'm needing these beans in these quantities to expand my menu:
Woohoo Blend: 10 Woo Beans Hoohoo Blend: 10 Hoo Beans Chuckle Blend: 10 Chuckle Beans Teehee Blend: 10 Hee Beans
...I think it stinks.
...Ho ho ho! Surprise! Yet another video conference!
Ho ho ho... No, there's no need for that.
Listen here. This brand-new Game Boy Horror boasts a new warping capability!
Thanks for that sampling. Here's a little something I invented in my spare time. Maybe it'll aid you.
...
If ever you have any hardships... or any sad days...
then you can gaze upon this picture and think of me...
There! Don't you think it brings a little respect to this shop and makes it slightly less...kiddy?
...How does it taste?
... ... ...
Delicious!
This may be the next big drink!
You've brewed well!
Hmm!
Hmm... Oh... Oog... All of a sudden I have a bad tummy-ache...
...Perhaps this drink I just drank is the cause of this ache...
...Further proof that every rose has its thorn...
Maybe you just drank too much?
Oooooh... Ohh... Umm... Uh-oh. WHERE'S THE RESTROOM?!?
Boss! You never built any toilets in this place!
Oh! Th-That's my Poltergust 3000! L-Luigi!
Are you planning on being the janitor around here?!?
Oh! Mercy! It seems to have been just heavenly.
Heeeeeeeeeee!
Just bring the new bean juice and place it before the monitor.
Once again I've come from afar because of the scent of a new kind of bean juice!
Ho ho! The warp was successful!
Hoolumbian 6 Woo Beans + 4 Hoo Beans
Oh! Hey, Boss! What's with that weird vacuum?
Oh! Another mind-numbingly deep flavor!
Chuckoccino 6 Woo Beans + 4 Chuckle Beans
This is a highly improved model of the Poltergust 3000... It's the Super Poltergust 3001!
If you've just got to know the improvements I've made...
Next time, I really will be there in person.
Teeheespresso 6 Woo Beans + 4 Hee Beans
It can now be ridden like this!
And it's incredibly speedy!
Well, here I am...in the flesh! It's been quite a while since I've seen you all here.
The more my menu expands, the more customers will come here to partake in my wonderful bean juice!
Oh! Hey, Boss!
Whoa! Your shadow is looking pretty thin, there...
You haven't been sick, have you?
Righto! Then show me the beans you've collected!
No, no, no! I'm just testing my latest invention: a gown that lets anybody become a ghost.
By wearing this gown, you can become a ghost anytime, anyplace, anywhere you want!
Will you join our StarB System? 
Yes 
Tell me again 
See ya
So, you've finally become a ghost yourself, eh, Boss?
Yep. And while I may be a ghost, I can still taste new drinks.
Ho ho! So, you've finally completed the last bean juice concoction missing from our menu...
This'll be my final tasting!
Pardon my hastiness, but may I have the first sampling?
Hoo... Since I know this is the last new flavor I will taste... I must say it's the finest yet!
Oh, stop exaggerating!
Hmm... This is a mysteriously dim, short-lived flavor...
It's just the kind of bean juice that'll attract the long-overlooked market of after-lifers!
Since I've now sampled all the drinks that there are to sample...
I'll most likely no longer be making any appearances here...
But as the owner, I feel I must leave this here in my shop.
Oh! I'm so sad!!!
Whoa! A power outage?
Whoa! A power outage?
Oh, man... I've got a bad feeling about this.
Looks like the aroma of your new drink has drawn out all the ghosts in the place.
Oh! I was wondering who it could be! If it isn't the beloved owner of our cafe... Professor E. Gadd!
Welcome to my Starbeans Cafe!
Seeing you two... This is a most unexpected chance meeting!
Hey! You guys know the owner?!?
That blending machine is our owner's latest invention.
Have you tried the drinks made by my latest invention: the wondrous Beanbean Machine?
Its stimulating flavor will put a spicy tingling in your cheeks. ...Yes, quite a tingling, indeed.
Hmm... The rich, aromatic fragrance of that drink...
I sense that it's a drink that even I haven't partaken of...
May... May I have a drink?
Hmm... A delicately bitter flavor, but one that makes me crave more.
This stuff gives me the energy to push my ghost research into a new dimension!
If only we had something to stabilize it with or some replacement parts...
We're on it! Let's comb this place over until we find something!
There are some strong-looking foes around here. Is that helpful?
Yes! We'll defeat them all!
Then we'll take whatever we can grab and get the Koopa Cruiser working again!
Keehee! You're pure evil.
Thank you! Now then, let's move out!
Yikes. It's kiiiind of falling apart, isn't it...
Huh. It was moving and making clicky mechanical sounds earlier...
I've been toying around with it...
And?! Can she fly?
Don't call it "she." Weirdo. And yes, I think it will get us home. Barely.
Awesome! Let's go right now!
HOWEVER. Parts of the Koopa Cruiser are scattered all across the kingdom...
If we try to fly it like this, it will probably crash again.
Take care, everyone!
Please come visit us in the Mushroom Kingdom someday!
Princess Peach, you have a fine group of friends. I am quite envious!
Toadsworth!
Lady Lima!
Princess Peach! Mario Bros!
I must thank you all!
Accept this gift from me to mark our parting!
Even if you beat these Piranha Plants in battle, the roots sprout new plants almost immediately!
We've been looking forever for some other way to defeat them...
Well done, Mario Bros! Now we can welcome Princess Peach to our fair kingdom!
This is a region map. It shows your current location and the location of Save Albums.
If you lose track of where you are, just check your map.
Yikes! W-What's with that rumbling?
This is a story of Minions. It unfolds as Mario and Luigi embark on an adventure all their own...
With the explosion of the Koopa Cruiser, Bowser's Minions were sent flying off to several distant locations...
One lone Goomba with ample gumption, who has been knocked unconscious in a far-off land, is in for a rude awakening...
What... Wh-Where am I? Where's Lord Bowser?
Where are my fellow Minions...?
Hello? Is anyone out there?
HELLOOO!
This is bad... I'm all alone and have NO idea where I am...
WAAAAAAH!!
I guess I should try... looking outside...
Kablam!
Kapow!!!
I'm so frightened at the thought of Cackletta being in here that I refuse to leave... Can't make me!
Is Queen Bean safe?
Which begs the question... How do we define a "living entity"?
So I researched...and researched... and researched still more...
This guy's got a screw loose. Let's get out of here...
Ah, but as with all things, conducting research requires a fat stack of coins.
So I decided to manage the Starbeans Cafe as a secondary source of income!
But alas, employing an outstanding staff... Inventing fantastic machinery...
I'm afraid all of these things require still more coinage...
Ah! Speaking of fantastic machinery, I'm also building a time machine.
Yes, quite. It shall be another fabulous addition to my long list of inventions!
In fact, I can't shake the feeling that a new adventure is on the horizon...
That's when all the ghosts within the Poltergust 3000 escaped!
Oh! Very good, indeed. Most excellent.
As it were, I was gathering Boos in this cave for my research...
However, I was met with a most unfortunate fate. I fell down. Ouch.
Umm... OK then.
Surely you fine fellows understand the urgency of the situation at hand.
You must bring the escaped Boos back to me!
My wondrous ghost research is on the verge of magnificent discovery!
No... Just...no.
Yes, you'll want my full backstory first. Expected. Understandable.
My research began with a simple question... What IS a ghost?
Incorporeal, yet visible... Their very existence defies the laws of science!
Of course, light refractions can make even dust look like a living being...
There was a time when ghosts were understood as holograms of a sort...
However! None of these hypotheses explain why ghosts produce shadows!
Not to mention their forboding laughter. Science has no answer for that one.
I pondered these conundrums for ages. Oh, the ponderings I pondered!
These factors informed my conclusion that ghosts are real, living entities!
Mario! Luigi! Thank you so much for all that you've done. I'm all right now.
You two can relax a little and walk around and enjoy the sights.
We can all meet up again a little bit later.
Are you going to Teehee Valley? 
No
Yes
Well, if it isn't Mario and Luigi!
Mario... Rumors of your deeds have reached even my ears.
And you, Luigi... Always looking after the home front! Well done!
Welcome to Little Fungitown!
I hope you'll enjoy your time here.
Wow! That's quite a commotion over there. I wonder what it is...
P-P-P-Princess Peach! Is-Is that you, Your Highness?
We-We'd heard you were coming from T-Toadsworth! But so soon?
We-We're so honored you've come all the way h-h-here!
A-A-And over here we have the s-s-superstar, M-M-M-Mario!
And L-L-Luigi!?! Are you for r-r-real?
We-We don't deserve such an in-in-in-incredible honor!
Thanks for your hospitality.
V-V-Very well then! A-Allow us to show you around L-Little Fungitown!
Hey! Come on! Can we go to Guffawha Ruins soon or what?
WHAT??? That place is dangerous! We can't go there! Are you out of your tiny little mind?
Fine, then, can we go to the new Game Arcade?
WHAT??? There are dangerous guys there! We can't go there! Are you crazy or what?
Eh? Mr. Mario isn't with you?
What?!? You say he's standing right before my eyes?
Um...Luigi? Did someone thump you on the head?
Aww... What a party pooper...
You rode a lift when you entered this town, didn't you?
They say that lift was made long ago by the people of the ancient Soybean Civilization.
It looks like I am indebted to you once again.
So, farewell!
I have fury!
Ah heh heh heh heh heh!
At last, my entrance with drama!
Finally! Now is the time where my true might shines, like many angry sunbeams of rage!
St-Standing in the spotlight at such a gala of spectacularity... My nerves are nervous!
But... Now that I am thinking... Cackletta's revival was all thanks to my quite nasty efforts!
Which means that all this time, I am Fawful, who is just a toady! Such working, all for others!
And THAT means... The true meaning of our battle gives me fear and confusion!!
I need no long speech before this battle, which will now be mighty! Snack on my wrath, fink-rats!
Urggh... Unless my mind is crazy, I have somehow managed to lose...
This must be...fate... Urrrgh... I must accept the defeating...
Hah! Now taste the finale, when carelessness opens the door to a comeback not expected by you!
HAH! In the finale of the finale, when negligence begets rashness, the comeback is come-back upon!
EE-YOUCH!
In the last moments of the finale of the finale, when relief leads to negligence that begets rashness...
That is when the comeback that faltered comes back and beats your pathetic comeback that I scoff at!
Your lives that I spit on are now but a caricature of a cartoon drawn by a kid who is stupid!
You shall all fall and vanish with your precious Beanbean Kingdom as I laugh heartily at you!
Qui-Quickly! Go to the Beanstar!
Ohhh, thank the stars! You've saved me! You heroic souls!
C-Could you be the Mario Bros. from the Mushroom Kingdom?
What are the Mario Bros. doing in a place like this?
What? You claim that I dropped the pair of you down here? And that I told you to fix the plumbing?
...Most perplexing...
Why, we were attacked by Cackletta and her fiends and have been stuck here ever since!
Hmm... Perhaps the "Lady Lima" you encountered was...
That thing that can grant all desires... The Beanstar...
We have always remained at this castle, acting as guardians...
Protecting the Beanstar and keeping it out of evil hands...
There's no doubt about it! Cackletta must be after the Beanstar! Oh, no!
Ohhhhhhh! Heroic Mario Bros! Quickly, now! You must go to the Beanstar! Go!
You must not let the Beanstar fall into the hands of evil!
Quickly! Quickly! Do not dawdle!
LORD BOWSER!
Alrighty! The time bomb has been placed...
Time to make our great escape!
Are you sure this is OK?
Private Goomp... Are you even listening to us?
I'm going to make a name for myself... under the great Lord Fawful...
YES! We're back in business!
Private Goomp...
This place has me feeling all... nostalgic.
I'm with you, Private Goomp. It's time to make a name for ourselves!

Heh heh! I'm going to get the first Beanstar piece! Just wait!
Be sure to give my regards to Senor Red Mustache!
Heh heh! I will most definitely be getting the next Beanstar piece!
Oh, and be sure to give my regards to Mr. Red Mustache!
   
May we meet again after gathering the Beanstar pieces!

Oh! Luigi! You saved me, didn't you? Why, thank you so much! You're a huge help!
But my, my, my, Luigi...
Look at how you've grown!!
To think that you know such cool moves! You're a real zero!
...I mean hero!
...I see. I guess I wasn't aware of the whole shrinking business!
Say, Luigi... I'm none too fond of this body size. Do you think you could change me back?
Heh heh! OK... But be careful!
Heh heh heh!
Look at the difference in my shine now that I'm back to normal! Zing! Now THAT'S a shine!
Thank you so much, Luigi!!!
*** Stray Piranha Plant Warning ***
Reports are coming in about an infestation of stray (and quite rabid) Piranha Plants in this area.
I feel like I must thank you. Please, I insist you accept this!
I found this inside that large Piranha Plant back there... Please take it!
Well, I've returned to my old self once again, so there's no point in staying here longer.
Down here under our feet...
...Is the giant, huge, really big mushroom known as the Great Mountain Mushroom!
But just how a mushroom could ever get so very big... remains a mystery.
This is quite high! Yes, quite! Do you think it's as tall as a mountain?
What a view! This is definitely worth all the trouble we went through to cross the desert.
Huh? Mr. Luigi... Are you traveling alone? Whoa.
Huh? You aren't Luigi? You say you're Mario?
Wa ha ha ha ha ha HAAA! Are you half-asleep or what?
Hey! If it isn't Mario and Luigi!
How do you like the view from up here, guys? Isn't it lovely?
Oh, that guy is such a jerk!
He knows I can't jump way over there, so he always runs off that way!!!
REAL MATURE, JERK!
Oooh! Man, that girl scares me!
This is the best place to get a little distance from her!
Without this place, I'd be...
If you head west from this town, you'll find the Guffawha Ruins.
All the adults say we shouldn't go there 'cause it's dangerous...
But telling me I can't go just makes me want to go more!
Have you ever felt that way?
You have cleared the challenge!
...Now for your next challenge.
You must defeat me!
You have passed this test, too! Now you must face the test of reaching the summit!
Ah. Travelers. I am Hoohooros. The ancient weapon of the Hoohoo civilization.
HP fully restored! BP fully restored!
Beyond this point, the path grows even crueler. You must prove yourselves up to the challenge...
Dare you try this challenge? 
No
Yes
You must start now. And you must catch 10 Hoohoo Spirits within 35 seconds!
Do not fall off the ledges, or you will immediately fail.
You failed!
Take this challenge again? 
No
Yes
You got the Green Pearl Bean!
Take care of this!
Your Rancidness!
We will soon pass over the border between the Mushroom and Beanbean Kingdoms.
Hmm! Nice work! You can go back belowdecks. Now.
Eh? What's with all the hoopla?
RAWR! What now?
Eeeyah ha ha ha ha!
Who would have thought you'd catch up to the Great Cackletta in even a hundred million years? 
You! You're the fiend who stole Peach's voice! How dare you pull off such a cool evil plan?
Eeyah ha ha ha! Oh, I dare!
And now I'm going straight back to the Beanbean Kingdom so my next plan can take root!
I have no time to chat with the likes of you!
I am the great Cackletta's most best pupil, who is named Fawful! I am here, laughing at you!
If you are giving us the chase just to get your silly princess's voice, then you are idiots of foolishness!
Princess Peach's sweet voice will soon be the bread that makes the sandwich of Cackletta's desires!
And this battle shall be the delicious mustard on that bread! The mustard of your doom!
Fawful!
Bah! Now is when the talking stops! I do not have time to stop and smell foul roses such as you!
One fell swoop is the way I will deal with you fink-rats!
Next it is the turn of you!
GWAAAARRR! HOLD IT!
Master Mario! I'm going on ahead. I shall be waiting for you in front of the Koopa Cruiser.
Yeah, so, I recently returned from a really nice trip to the Beanbean Kingdom.
Ah, Hoohoo Mountain, Oho Ocean, Chucklehuck Woods, Teehee Valley... So much to see!
I've recorded all my travels in my Save Album!
Oh, Master Mario! I almost forgot! You have quite a long road before you this time! Yes, quite long, indeed!
You mustn't forget to record your travel data in your Save Album before you depart!
Bowser's Koopa Cruiser is parked just up ahead. Hoo! That is one mean machine! Boy!
...Anyway, it's time you were on your way! Head in that direction once you're ready, OK? But, uh...
Rushing headfirst into trouble like you always do is crazy, so be sure to save with that Save Album!
Ah! You're just seeing Master Mario off? A capital idea! I do believe I'll join you.
Master Mario!
It would appear I'm just in time!
I have prepared a suitcase for you to take with you on your long journey!
I'm quite sure it will prove useful, as it holds many items and outfits. Please take it!
You got a suitcase!
Just press START to open your suitcase and check the menu screen.
Then you can use any items you've found on your journey or even change your clothes...
It's also a good idea to use that screen to double-check your personal status.
...Once you board the Koopa Cruiser you can take your time and look through it.
Now then, I have one more parting gift, as it were: some funds for your trip! Here you go...
You got 100 coins!
Oh, gracious! Master Luigi! Are you going to the Beanbean Kingdom, as well?
CRRRACKITY!!!
Wh-Who dares to touch the great Thunderhand spark?!? Impertinent fool!
...And yet... You have touched the great Thunderhand spark, but still stand before me, so...
...Perhaps you have the qualities needed to master the galvanic Thunderhand technique...
Very well... I shall instruct you in the art of the Thunderhand.
Only then shall you release a burst of thunder and lightning.
Perhaps you should try it once.
Don't worry... I only pretend to be dead. Ha ha funny.
I think I am myself, reborn!
Eebity-eh-eh-eccch!
You took my experience points!
Select Thunder, and then hold and release the  Button!
First, use the touch screen or the  or  Button to select Thunder...
Hmm! Very well done...
It is wise to use this power when an apparent conductor of electricity is nearby.
You have done it! It is done! You have released me!
Eebity eebity...
Eebity eebity eebity eebity eebity eebity eebity eebity eebity eebity eebity BLEEB!!!
To you who have wandered into Thunder Palace...
These are the training grounds for the chosen few.
I know not how you found your way here, nor how you managed to enter this place...
But I have no business with you...and you have none with me. Depart, posthaste.
Luigi mastered the Thunderhand!
Stop training and return to the menu? 
No
Yes
Hold the  Button until you have charged up enough energy...
Hold the  Button until you have charged up enough energy...
Then release the button!

The Ultra Mushrooms sold here are of the very finest quality!
They are a local specialty that are only sold here. I think.
Sometimes, I get such a craving for this shop's Ultra Mushrooms...
...that I brave the many dangers of the desert just to come buy them. I'm crazy like that.
Welcome to my item shop!
Since you've come all the way to Little Fungitown, you'd miss out if you didn't buy a Mushroom!
Come again.
Hrmm... Wow. If you've come all the way here, you obviously don't give up easily. Cool.
So this is a present from me to you...
Press the  and  Buttons to hit the blocks that come flying and score points.
If you get 25 points in 25 seconds or less, I'll open this door for you. Cool?
Would you like to try again? 
No
Yes
It seems that successfully using the  and  Buttons to hit the blocks that appear will cause the door to open.
Such are the findings of our research...
Time's up!
Want to try the experiment again? 
No
Yes
You beat the challenge!
Yes! The trial was a success!!
Here are the results of our experiment...

Gah! Don't talk to me! It's distracting!!!
Hmph... This game cheats! ...!!! I was shielding! SHIEEELDING!!! NO!!! I did NOT press that!
Welcome! What do you say? Would you like to play?
Give it a try! If you get a super-nice score, I'll give you a free Invincibility Mushroom!
WOW! Nice score! Super-nice, even!
All righty! Here you go!
Umm-yum! Isn't it delectable?
Oh, I'm still adjusting things. Please wait a bit longer.
I just got a new game in! Seriously! You'll love it! I swear!
You received an Invincibility Mushroom!
Welcome! What do you say? Wanna play a game?
If you play my game and get a super-high score, I'll give you a free Invincibility Mushroom!
...At least, I WOULD, if they weren't out of stock. So, instead...
If you get a super-high score, I'll give you a free bean!
Old Bloat is even more of an "ostaf" than before!

You're first, Green Bean!
Use the touch screen or the  or  Button to select Tickle...
Yeah! Make 'em feel it!
Right down that spine...
With electrical tickle power, you can push things with your back or walk from side to side.
Yeah! You can use this move to dash super-fast or even knock stuff over! Feel the power!
And now, the time has come to use it! Are you excited?
Great! Try to bump into me with your back!
Come on! Bring it!
Hurry up and push, Merri!!!
Nice!!! Yowser!!! Wowser!!!
Wow! You're a tickle technician!
Nice!!! Super!!! Duper!!!
You're a dash adept!!!
N-Next is the Red Pearl Bean! Oh, get it! Please!
Hurry! Quickly, now!!!
N-Next is the Green Pearl Bean! Oh, please! Get it! Get it!
Come on! Hurry! Faster!!!
Oh! Gigi!
I know this is being super-picky, but you're forgetting one thing!
Oh! That's right!
Of course... When you want to stop dashing...
Turn in any direction other than the one you're facing, or just press the  Button!
Listen, I don't mean to be a pill, but if you refuse, you'll have to pay for your lesson...
That won't do, sillies! You can't break the rock while you're accelerating or decelerating!
Go back and try again!
It's your turn next, Red.
Truly, THIS time, we've taught you everything that we can.
Select Dash, and then hold and release the  Button!
Choose Tickle, and then hold and release the  Button. Use  to move!
Build up your Thunder Power with the  Button...
Build it up... And when you just can't contain the electricity...
When you're about to explode... Release the  Button!
When you electrify the person in front of you with this move...
you can use  to both move on the same path!
No! That's wrong! I want you to hit me with your back! C'mon!
Charge up your Fire Power with the  Button...
Right down the spine!
Make it stingly!
Send a big jolt of electricity racing down the back! Yeah!
Choose Dash on the touch screen or with the  or  Button.
Super! Then let's get you a little practical experience!
I want you to dash right into this rock! C'mon!
When you feel the fiery power build to a dangerous level...
When you're about to ignite... release the  Button!
AHHHH-HYAHHHH!
Super! And that's all we have to teach you!
...Now that that's done, we have a little job for you!
That's right, Merri! We need you to use that technique to get the two Pearl Beans in this cave!
Your power is much, much more powerful than ours!
That's why you can get the two Pearl Beans! 
OK! All right! Hurry! Do it! We need both Pearl Beans! Yeah! Woo! Go! GO!
Oh, yeah! Nice! Sooo nice!!! A Red Pearl Bean!
Oh, good! Oh, good! SO GOOD!!! A Green Pearl Bean!
With power!
Tickle boldly!
Make 'em feel tickle fever as it burns, burns, BURRRRNS!
Stop training and return to the menu? 
No
Yes
I wanted this so bad!!!
Oh, I'm swooning!

Dear Mustachioed Gentlemen: The two blocks here are called Simu-Blocks.
If both of these blocks are struck simultaneously, something will occur...
Hey!
Watch it, you clumsy oafs! Don't break the Great Bowser's cargo! It's important stuff!
...The deck?
The deck's just up ahead.
Uh... But before you go there, I need to make sure you won't slow Lord Bowser down...
So... I'll teach you how to fight as a pair! 
No thanks
Please do
All right, but it's not my fault if you get in hot water later because you think you know everything.
Want to break the barrel? 
No
Yes
C'mere, you!
Hahhh... Hooffff... Haarfff... It's too quick! I can't catch it...
And I have to get ready for Beanbean immigration...
Oh! It's Mario and...Mr. Greenie! Can you two help me out?
I'll teach you something important about going into battle in the process! No charge!
Now, you can catch these guys...
But first, you have to stomp 'em and start a battle.
Hoo! Thanks!
Hey, can you get that other guy?
Now I'm all ready!
Thanks! Remember, when you see enemies, just stomp, stomp, stomp 'em into the ground!
Just make sure the Bro in back doesn't get hit!
Then go have a look at that barrel over there. But remember...
You're about to face the best of Bowser's most elite troops, so prepare yourselves.
Move along! Nothing to see!
Check that barrel over there.
Yes, Boss!
...
I can't believe it just came falling down out of nowhere... It was shocking, see?
But having treasure fall out of the sky sure is lucky! Yeah! That's right! Verrry lucky!
Only Popple the shadow thief could get such results, see?
You're amazing, Boss!
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Uh-Unless my eyes are screwy...
Look there! It's Red and Green from the Chateau!
Well, boo! Boo to you, I say!
Why does this always happen?!?
This isn't funny, see?
Rookie!
These two numbskulls seem to like the old ring-a-ding-ding! Time to scrap again, see?
Oh, no! Our treasure! It's gonna fly away, see?
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Hey, Boss! What's that shiny thing?
This shape... This shine... This AURA, see?!

Sirs! You're after Gigi and Merri, aren't you!
The miracle hand massage of the tickle technicians Gigi and Merri is incredible!
But words don't do it justice... You must experience it!
Yes! I knew you'd say that! Let the lesson begin!
We'll show you two guys two absolutely incredible techniques that'll make your hands magical!
Those who don't listen will get left behind! Buh-bye!
Welcome, travelers! This is the Relaxation Room, where we ease your weary body and spirit!
Our massage masters use their miracle hands to give you a gentle, calming massage.
100 coins gets one individual a thorough, if brief, rubdown!
...You don't have enough coins. I'm sorry, but please come back after saving up stress and cash.
Great! That comes to 200 coins... in advance, thank you!
It's not healthy to let stress build up, you know!
Now then, you can sit on the chairs in that room and wait.
Please head to the chair room right now. Run along!
Gigi and Merri were so excited by the Pearl Beans episode that they've fallen fast asleep.
As a result, the Relaxation Room is closed for a while.
...Gigi and Merri are very intrigued by you two.
Oh, hey there! WELCOME! How're you? Super! I'm Gigi.
Now, let's get right to it! Show me where you're sore.
Ooh! Show me too! Please! 'Cause I'm Merri, and I despise soreness! It's my sworn enemy!
Oh, look at this... Your hands are so very, very tired...
HP fully restored! BP fully restored!
...And you, too! This is awful! Your hands are so tired, they look ready to hibernate!
Now, don't worry! Our miraculous hands will gently coax the weariness from you. Promise!
Oh! Jeepers! What's this?!?
Wowser! I mean, double wowser! You've mastered the Firebrand!?!
Oh my goodness! How shocking!
You've mastered the Thunderhand!
You guys aren't ordinary travelers, are you?
Aren't you two fascinating! As miracle hand technicians, we're masters of hands like yours!
Oh, yes! That's SO true, Merri! Why, with your Hand Powers, you could even get those...
ANYWAY... I've gotta say, you guys don't need massages!
Instead, we'll do you one better: we'll teach you two very special Hand techniques!
What do you say? 
No thanks
Teach us
Oh! How...weak. But we won't give up easily, you two!
We'll be waiting right here for you! Count on it!
You'll want us to teach you soon! Oh, yes, you will!
Miracle Hand Massages 30 minutes: 100 coins per person
For the both of you it'd only be 200 coins. What do you say? 
No thanks
Please!
Well, we've got strength covered, but we never worked out cuteness...
That stumpy body... Those dynamic eyebrows... Those adorable feet!
You're from the beyond spectaculous Mushroom Kingdom, aren't you?!
It's fine! We'll just...
ARE YOU A GOOMBA?!
Oh! We'll try the ol' shy cutie act! That should be right up your alley!
Yes... As a matter of fact, I am.
Just remember...this is all for Lord Bowser...
Ahhhh!!
I'm just sooo shy...
Yep. Sooo full of shyness...
Just look at how shy yet cute I am...
*squeeeee* I knew it! The most expendable of all the MK baddies!
Nope, that won't do at all. We'll get points deducted.
Oooh, let me touch him!! I wanna touch him!
Uh, yeah... Y'all didn't hear me, didja?
You think? And here I thought it looked pretty darn good.
The mysterious cutie angle is really underutilized these days...
You ARE touching me! Now stop it!
They say shy cuties actually rule the world! Don't they say that?
Arrrghh!
I... I just...
That t-t-tickles!
I hate this. I'm so sad inside right now.
Unbelievable! His skin is so much smoother than expected!

They scored shockingly few Cutie Points, but their strength was top-notch!
The Goomba Squad has cleared the first round. Only two more rounds to go.
If you guys so much as sneeze funny, it's not gonna end well for you.
W-Wait a second! What is WITH you weirdos!
After that, they'll face off with the leader of this shindig, Lady Wendy!
AHAHAHA! No, stop! That tickles!
Huh? Those guys... I thought they arrived with some Koopa Troopas.
Hey! How old are you? What's your sign?
They don't seem to have any Koopa Troopas with them, no.
How tall are you? Huh? Tell me! Half a Bowser? A quarter?
Hmph. Fine then.
Who's the REAL leader of the Koopalings? Ludwig?
All that matters is that I'm the guaranteed winner of this contest!
Wow, those folks are persistent...
You're speaking pretty loudly for something that's a secret...
I'll prove I'm the most beastly beauty on the beach! All will bow down before me!
Aaaand they're gone. Hurry! Let's follow her!
I see what's going on. You, too, are entering Mistress Wendy's most noble contest!
Then everything on this beach will belong to Lord Fawful and me...
Teehee! Just thinking about it fills my heart with girlish glee!
Phooey! We lost her.
No... No, I'm not.
CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!
First, the beastly powerhouses... THE CHARGIN' CHUCK BRIGADE!
This contest will test not only your cuteness, but your strength as well!
Ooh, it's close! A five-point difference! But the winner of this battle is...
The very picture of brute strength! They're frightening...ly...um, cute!
Squad! It's time to show off what we've been practicing!
Team Red!
WOOOOO!!!
Ready, set...FIGHT!
THE GOOMBA SQUAD!!
Yeaaaaah!!
OK... I think... No! I know! I've made up my mind.
Let's give it a shot. Let's... win this contest!
Now it's finally time for the semifinals!
Next, we have the enchanting starlets...THE STAR ANGELS!
Hey, no fair!
You're just feeling arrogant because you beat us!
YES! We did it!
The audience is filled with adoration for the sweet-yet-sassy Starlow!
Rumor has it she's been practicing a super secret cutie technique!
Uh, hey, honey pie! Slow down, baby!
Paraplonk, won't you please join us?
WAIT! What's going on here?!
I thought the Chargin' Chuck Brigade was guaranteed to win!!
And now, the strange creatures of the beach... THE CRAZY SISTERS!
LEAVE. ME. ALONE!
Ah... Yes... That IS what you said, isn't it...
Sorry, I got so excited I just...
They sure are...unique. Anyhow! I now present you with our dark horse!
Heh. I've got thome really cute decorationth on me.
Make no mithtake, world! I'm gonna win thith cutie battle contetht!
Ahem, sorry. Sadly, it's too late to reverse my official decision...
Uh, honey pie? Say it ain't so...
IDIOT! Now I have no choice but to fix this myself!
The plan was for me to walk away with an easy win...
But now I'll just have to smash that Goomba Squad into jelly!
Don't thump me between my eyeth! That ith THO inconthiderate!
That big guy... Am I losing it, or was he wearing a Bob-omb?
Sweet honey pieeee! Are you, uh, OK?!
Uh, yeah, can I maybe get a huggy wuggy?
He was. And also something yellow, round, and somewhat feisty...
Why is everyone here insane?! Especially YOU! Take the hint!
For the last time, I am NOT your honey pie!
Uh, hey! Fellas! Y'all look strong and capable, baby!
You've just GOTTA save my honey pie!
You are ALL on my very last nerve!
Listen up! I'm the famous starfish star, Spangle.
That, uh, nutty Hermie III went and stole my sweet honey pie away!
Who, us? But we have nothing to do with that guy...
Wait... Does he expect us to... save her or something?
Let's try practicing...
Whatever. I'm gonna go and try to enjoy the rest of my vacay.
Well, I'd like to anyway. But there's a "cutie battle contest" going on...
Maybe I should enter! If I strut my stuff, I'll win for sure...
That yellow lady... Maybe we should recruit her!
She looks helpful, doesn't she? And cute. I bet she's smart...
No... On second thought, that's a bad idea.
Honestly, things are crazy enough as it is...
Too true, Cap.
Yes! You contestants will now hold a team battle right here on this beach!
As you fight, focus on showing off your cuteness and strength!
We have no more business here. Let's forget this ever happened.
Overdoing it loses you points. Wardrobe slips are FORBIDDEN!
Uh, yeah. I'm good with that.
That all sounds manageable! We've just gotta keep winning!
Mistress Wendy! Come on, let's go!
Oh, but there may be more Minions on her side. Be on alert, everyone!
Huh? Are you serious?! What's your PROBLEM?
But what about... Ummmm... Right.
I'm afraid the Goomba Squad loses... for...uhhhh...leaving the stage!
That means the winner of Lady Wendy's First Annual Cutie Battle Contest is...
Well, just give it a fair shot...
HEY! Please, hold on a minute! This is a personal space violation!
Will the next contestants please come this way!
Let me stomp on you! Pleaaase! Just a little!
Come on! That's our cue!
Ha, yeah! I wanna hear him make that cool "bwoop" sound!
This is nooot going to end well...
STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT!
Team Blue! The Boomerang Bros!
Hello, boys. Did you come all the way here just to see little ol' me?
Battle points...60! Cutie points...30!
That adds up to 90 points total!
Mistress Wendy!
Team Red! The Goomba Squad of Bowser's Minions!
I'm no fool, you know. I've heard ALL about your little adventure.
Rumor has it you went and stabbed poor Iggy and Larry in the back...
Battle points...80! Cutie points...20!
That makes for 100 points total!
I wouldn't say WE were the ones doing the stabbing...
That means our adorable winner of this round is...
Did you say something, worm?! In any case, you're too late.
Team Red!
Soon, this whole place will be a private beach just for Lord Fawful and me!
Though small, they put up a good fight! THE GOOMBA SQUAD!
They lacked in Cutie Points in round one, but how will they fare in round two?!
Ugh. This contest is a bunch of nonsense...
I just want to save Mistress Wendy and move on to the next Koopaling...
And just WHERE is our head of cutie affairs?!
Sulking over there...
He seems to genuinely hate his new job title.
Hm? Did you say something?
Ah! Or perhaps he's in shock at how few Cutie Points we got!
Keeheeheeee!
Mistress Wendy? Now?!
Incredular!
Lady Wendy is the BEST! My new fave, for realsies.
Team Blue! The Chargin' Chuck Brigade!
That's perfect! We can end this right here, right now.
I honestly can't stand another second of this anyway...
"Enter my contest, bwaha!" She SAID that! To us!
Battle points...70! Cutie points...40!
That's 110 points total!
Really. I'd rather be defeated.
I can't believe she really said that!
Team Red! The Goomba Squad of Bowser's Minions!
Ooh, the Chief Cutie is here! Having too much fun, keehee?
A cutie battle contest! How fresh! How fabuloid!
And the cutest, strongest team will win... Classic!
I guess?
Battle points...100! Cutie points...15!
That's 115 points total!
Hmph! You got lucky when you beat Iggy and Larry!
I, however, won't show mercy. Prepare to be black and blue!
Ooh, and if we go, we'll get to meet THE Bowser's Minions!
Nothing could stop me from going, it's sounds fantabulous!
Yeah, baby! You've just gotta save her! I'm begging ya'll!
Keep at it! NEXT! One! Two! Three!
NOOO! How could this happen?!
A cutie...battle contest?
We don't care either way about your "honey pie." That's your own business.
We're just going to rescue our Bob-omb buddy and skedaddle.
YEAH!
Phew! Thank goodness that's over.
Are we really taking an aside to save one little Bob-omb?
That's it! Now, the finale!
Small or large, it matters not! He's a fellow Minion!
Huh? I could...do that? Really?
Ultra Super Phenomenal Spinning Spark of Glory! GOOOOOO!!
Hey! Let go of my—
Of course! Let's go and face Mistress Wendy together.
If we work together, we'll win for sure!
YEAAAAAH!
Hey! You!
Let's not, how about?
Yes, good! VERY good! Bravo! Bravissimo!
UNHAND ME!
Yeah, I hate this idea too.
Huh? Is that...Goomba?!
Oh my gosh! Have you heard? The big, juicy rumor...
Gyaaaah!
Aww, you don't mean that!
This is our chance to turn poor Mistress Wendy back to normal!
Corporal Paraplonk! What are you doing?
Well, duh! It's only the most fantastical thing ever! We've ALL heard about it!
Oh! Ouch! Ouchie! The intenth pain! The thuffering! That hurth, I thay!
YEAH! Since it's decided, I'd say it's time for some special training!
How DARE you spy on the Paraplonk Squad's secret training!
They say the Mushroom Kingdom crew is here! Could life be more stupendular?!
Hmm. We're solid on strength, but how do we get cuter...
I NEED to see Princess Peach with my own eyes. Is that too much to ask?!
Ooh, yeah! I'd love for Bowser to kidnap me! How fun would that be?!
It's tiiiiime for the CUTIEEEE...
WAIT. ONE. MINUTE. Could that be... Don't tell me that's really a...
BAAAAATTLE...
Oh! OH!! It totally is! It's like I'm dreaming!
THAT SOUND! So gloriful!
Hey! You! Lookit me! Hey, hi, yes, hello!
What's up? Did you want something?
Yeah, good call.
Whirlwind Warning
If you have faith in your spin, step into the wind.
Eeyah ha ha ha!
I have fright! A situation we had not suspected has begun to d-d-d-develop! May we flee?
EEYARGH!
Pests! Loathsome pests! And at the worst possible moment!
We don't have time to deal with you fools!!!
Hah! Hmph! Well, won't this be fun! Oh, yes!
If that's how it is, I'm ready for you!
I'm going to knock you all the way back to the Mushroom Kingdom!
Graagh! Eeyaaa...ha...hohhh...
H-How could this happen?!?
CACKLETTA! Do not have worries!
Watch! I am sucking up your energy with this headgear!
Oh... Oh... Oh, Fawful!!!
Give them one final...
attack for me!
Hooniversity Basement ↑
I say to you YES!
Now! Quickly! To the fallen Beanstar!
What? The Beanstar heard Princess Peach's voice and went mad?
But why would Princess Peach's voice drive the Beanstar mad?
I sense a surprising secret at the center of this riddle!
I shall explain it all in detail once we have safely recovered the Beanstar that has fallen below.
You two must go to the bottom floor immediately!
Preparations have completion!
Eeyah ha ha ha!
O Great Cackletta, unleash the voice of Princess Peach on the Beanstar when you are wanting to!
The moment when all the world will bow down to me has come at last...
Peach-bots! SPEAK!!!
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Eeyah ha ha...HUH?!?
Wh-Wha-What happened?!? What is this???
This is a region map. It shows your current location and the location of Save Albums.
If you lose track of where you are, just check your map.
Huh? Buh? What in the... Hey! Who did this? Who put cargo in this area?!?
How are we supposed to get to the deck with this in the way?!?
Hey! According to the book "Beanbean Vacations"...
You can save your travels by hitting that album there!
Hitting that block there activates the Pinch Crane. I like to call it Mr. Pinch. Don't ask me why.
In case it's not really obvious, you should be able to use ol' Mr. Pinch to move that cargo.
Save Album ↑ 
Hit it often to save your travels.
Uh-oh! Looks like the crane mistook you for cargo... That looks...uncomfortable.
Hey! Since you're up there, why don't we use you as a lookout!
Hey-hey!
Welcome to the Pipe House!
I'm here to teach you everything you want to know about pipes!
Want to ask about pipes? 
No
Yes
Which do you want to ask about? 
Green Pipes
Yellow Pipes
Right, right. Green. Jump in a green pipe to warp to another green pipe elsewhere in this land.
You just choose a green pipe you've jumped in before, and you'll warp to it! Easy-peasey!
So, if you find a green pipe, you'd better jump in on principle. Seriously, just for a second!
The more green pipes you jump into, the easier it'll be to travel around the kingdom quickly!
There are thirteen green pipes in all, OK? Got that?
Yellow pipes are for travel between the seafloor and the surface or between above- and belowground.
There are lots in ocean and desert areas, so when you're in those regions, jump in the yellow pipes!
Can I stop there? 
Yes
Tell me more
See you later!
...Study a little on your own.
Don't come if you won't ask...
...Hold it, you two.
Eh? Me? I'm Jojora.
I'm a buddy of the cousin of the descendant of the spirit who once guarded this place.
 
Princess Peach? Bowletta?
Man, I have NO idea what you're talking about!
...Whatever. Look, if you want to go inside, then go right ahead. Be my guest. Go nuts.
I don't know what kind of adventure you've been on to get here, but man...
Getting through here won't be nearly as easy as what you're used to! No way!
This palace is our playground, understand?
Do you two want to play here, too?
In that case, the least you could do is say hello to those of us who were here first.
Oh, Mario! Thank you!
I always believed you would save me.
 
If ya happen to place a stamp in the Records menu, show me!
I'll give ya a little somethin' for your efforts!
Who'da thought, huh?
Stamp collectin' ain't just for letter-writers anymore!
Yeaaaah. Also, if ya have a Goomba, Boo, or Koopa Troopa amiibo, ya can let me know!
If ya do that, bud, I'll hand over any Stamp Sheets ya can make use of!
Have ya been collectin' stamps, bud? 
Show stamps 
Goomba/Koopa Troopa/Boo amiibo 
Good-bye
Halt! You there! Halt! You can't just waltz on in here!
The town has just been attacked! Which means the castle could be attacked at any moment!
Whoa, get a look at that... I can hardly believe what I'm seein'!
As promised, here's your reward. Go on, it's yours!
Lady Lima has instructed us not to allow anyone to enter the castle! Anyone whatsoever!
Having said that, if you still wish to enter, you must explain your names and your motives!
WHAT???
Received  coins!
YOU are the world-famous Mario!?!
And YOU are the legendary Luigi!?!
Uh, Luigi who?!?
Princess Peach and Queen Bean have been waiting for you in the queen's chambers.
Have ya been collectin' stamps, bud? 
Show stamps 
Good-bye
When we were attacked from the sky, I thought we were done for...
Shh! I have no idea...
Th-That's terrible! And sort of disgusting! We must contact Lady Lima immediately!
If you really are the superstar Mario from the Mushroom Kingdom, then prove it!
Hmm! By the way... What's Chuckola Reserve?
Th-That jump...
So... Do ya have any amiibo... that look like this? 
No
Yes
Mario! Luigi!
No mistaking it!
Lady Lima has asked that you also take this along with you.
Th-This guy is really Mario???
That thing is a badge.
If you equip it, you'll be a little stronger in battle.
Different badges have different effects, so...
For now, if you get a badge, make sure you equip it!
Shh! ...I can't be certain.
Received a Chuckola Badge!
Received Shroom Slacks!
Received Mush Badge A!
Received #1 Trousers!
Received Mush Badge AA!
Received Bowser Fang!
Received Mushluck Pants!
To equip it, press START to open your suitcase.
Heya, bud! You heard about these things called stamps?
There's these rumors around town...
Seems there are these things called amiibo that can be used as stamps.
That's cool, that's cool. No worries, bud!
I've never seen one myself!
I'm embarrassed to ask, bud... But ya don't happen to have one of these amiibo stamps, do ya?
Received  of each bean type!
If ya have an amiibo, ya can get it ready to stamp!
I'll give ya a little somethin' if ya got one to show me!
Really?! Sweet! Can ya show me, bud?
Oh, wow! There's no mistakin' it. That's one of those stamps the rumors are talkin' about!
Now then... Could ya maybe... go ahead and stamp on here?!
Received  Super Mushrooms! 
You received the Mario & Friends Stamp Sheet!
Received  Max Mushrooms!
You received the Bowser's Minions Stamp Sheet!
Received  Super Syrups!
Received  Max Syrups!
Received  Super Nuts!
Received  Max Nuts!
Received  1-Up Mushrooms!
Received  1-Up Supers!
Received  Golden Mushrooms!
That was the idea, anyway. But it looks like you're overloaded as is!
Tell ya what. Use up  of that item. Got it, bud?
Do that, and then come see me!
Hey! Lookie here! My bud is BACK!
Go on, then. Go ahead and take your reward.
Anyway... What business would the famous Mario and Lui-uh... other guy have in this castle?
If ya collect any other stamps, ya can put 'em on this Stamp Sheet!
Now you're all set! Good luck! And be careful!
Hmm! Ah! Ho ho!
Oh, uh... Sorry, Luigi, but if you want your own badge, you'll have to go buy one at the store.
Huhhh?
Ohhhh!
I see! Gotcha!
Hey, there! Long time, no see!
What do they want?
How ya been? Keepin' busy? Oh, by the by! We moved.
The new place is bigger than the last. Gives us more elbow room!
No clue...
Everyone in Hoohoo Village has already bought our Hammers.
That means there's nobody left to make 'em for! Cryin' shame.
That's why we moved to the big city. Gotta expand our horizons!
...Enough!
Regardless of all that nonsense, you may not enter!
Now begone!
We're livin' like big shot superstars here, heh!
Prince Peasley's Rose!
Are you friends of the prince?
Our new digs are beyond the east side of the village. Drop by soon!
If you bring your Hammers, we'll power 'em up for you!
Umm, listen, I think maybe we ought to let these guys inside!
Anyhow. See ya!
Umm... OK. Taking into account that rose and your wacky story, we can allow you to enter!
What?! Your Stamp Sheets are all filled up!
You're a real stamp champ!
Can't believe I've lived to see so many stamps.
In fact, I'm gonna embark on a journey in search of new ones!
Yeaaaah. That's what. Farewell, bud!
That was one wacky story! Woo!
This is Beanbean Castle!
Hmmm!!! Well, look at this! A very Mario-esque fellow and a Loo... uh, some other guy!
Whaaaaaaat?!?
What is it?
Mario's gut is filled to the brim with Chuckola Reserve? It's sloshing around his insides?!? Gross!
This is all really strange... Oh, well! I guess it's OK.
And hey, I didn't even have to use my super secret cutie smile attack!
You recruited Koopaling Wendy!
Allow me to introduce our final cutie battlers...
These beguiling individuals will be moving on to the second round!
WOOOOO!!!
Yeaaaaah!!
CONTEEEEEEST!!!
YAAAY!!
*HYPER SQUEEEE*
Today, overwhelming power will be paired with captivating cuteness!
Only the master of both shall prevail!
And the ones who will wage this exciting battle for ultimate victory are...
YOU GUYS!!!
The...UHHHH... The Star Angels!!
Huh? Did she just say what I think she just said?!
Uh, yay! We won, honey pie!!
S-So... We have a big surprise for you, folks!
She was scheduled for the final battle, but here she is now! LADY WENDY!!
Ladies and gentlemen! The wait is over!
Mountain Climbing Tips
For low ledges, use the  Button. The key is to save your strength by jumping simultaneously!
Be sure to check the mini map and plot out your climbing route.
Hoohoo Mountain Trail →
I'm tired of living in the sticks. I want to live someplace cool, where there's lots to do!
I think I get it now. In short...
Melee troopers always prefer the front line!
Ranged troopers always line up at the back!
Flying troopers go behind Melee and in front of Ranged troopers!
So that's the gist of it... I think I've got this down!
If you wanna see more detailed info on this, check out the guide!
A new entry was added to your Battle Basics guide.
Oh, another thing. There's something I should warn you about.
I'll throw an example your way...
Say the enemy comes at you with Melee and Ranged troopers.
Now that we've got more allies, we're looking like a real squad!
Yep! By the way, have you figured out the rules for how units line up?
Huh? Oh... Why don't you remind me. Just so we're on the same page.
Well, we Melee troopers charge at nearby enemies, right?
That means we're most useful on the front line.
Hm, yes. That makes sense.
As for us Ranged troopers, we excel at providing rear support.
That means we definitely prefer to line up in the back!
Noted!
Finally, us Flying troopers like to line up...right here!
You, in turn, fight back with Melee and Flying troopers.
The Melee troopers in front will start by fighting the closest opponents...
That means the Flying troopers in back will fight the enemy Ranged troopers.
My Flying troopers would be up against the Ranged troopers they're weak against!
That's right. So, for this same example...
Ah, I see. There's no one they're weak against! They can win this!
True! How your units can contribute in battle depends on their placement too.
Roger! I'll plan my formations so my units are never at a disadvantage!
Dare to dream, Cap! We're all counting on you!
It would be best to deploy only Melee troopers.
Get in line, cutters!
Is this zit noticeable?
I always look so awful in photographs.
With those, they'll let you into the Beanbean Kingdom.
Those are official documents now, so no retakes!
I mean it! This is my serious voice! Hands off the lens, fiends!!
Hey there! You two!
Yeah! You two mustache dudes!
You're about to enter the Beanbean Kingdom, so you have your passports with you, right?
These won't get you into the Beanbean Kingdom! No sir, no way, no how!
Don't wig out about it, though. If we take your pictures here, you should be just fine.
Since the Great Bowser has called you to the deck, I'll let you two cut the line.
I'm busy taking pictures! Don't talk to me right now!
Snapping photos is easy!
Just stand on that mat there. See it? Right there.
Hmm... That goes there... and this goes here...
OK, Mario, you step back, nice and easy.
Working the hold isn't easy... And if you mess up, you have to start all over again.
Now, Mr. Green 'Stache, you step back.
Oh! Mario! It's me! That lost guy!
OK! I'm gonna take it!
Hey, thanks for telling me which way to go back in the Mushroom Kingdom! I was kind of panicking...
But thanks to you, I was the first one to board the Koopa Cruiser!
Here! Let me give you this...
It's nice to be nice!
Criminy. My eyes are half closed in this one...and it's my passport photo to boot!
I'll have to get it retaken when we get to the Beanbean Kingdom. That's all there is to it!
Well, it looks like you've got a suitcase there...
Tell you what: go ahead and press START or tap the MENU icon to open your suitcase, OK?
Oops! I forgot to tell you...
Listen, when you're getting your picture taken, stand still.
Don't go pressing ↑ ↓ ← or → on the +Control Pad to hold a pose!
Stand still, will ya? It's important.
Don't go pressing ↑ ↓ ← or → on the +Control Pad to hold a pose!
Step onto the mat once you're ready! No hurry!
Hey! I'm not done taking your picture yet, Mr. Twitchy!
I already took your photo, Mario. Duhhhh!
I already took your photo, Mr. Green 'Stache. Duhhhh!
And away we go!
Ready? Say CHEEP CHEEP!
You're next, Mario.
You're next, Mr. Green 'Stache.
Great! I've taken passport photos for both of you! Aren't we all happy now? Happy all around!
You're not going anywhere!
Oh! Yes! Yes! You are PERFECT!!! How about a picture!
Right! Oh, yeah! Let's do it! I'll snap a great picture of you!
Well? Want a picture taken? 
Yes
No
OK. One picture is  coins.
 coins... 
OK!
No thanks
Whaaaat? Noooo? You don't want your picture taken? Not at all?
Oh! The life of an artist is so hard sometimes!
OK... How about for...  coins?
 coins? OK? 
OK!
No thanks
Oh, yes! Yes! I'm taking it! OK! Stand there on that mat! C'mon, now!
Stand still!
Don't go pressing ↑ ↓ ← or → on the +Control Pad to do some silly pose!
All righty! Are you ready?
Say CHEEP CHEEP!
Ah!
More! More! You need more coins!
Jump simultaneously by pressing the  Button!
Yeah, so, you may not know this, but we Bowser Baddies recently added a new member.
Yup. He's in training until we land in the Beanbean Kingdom.
If you see a Bros. Block, make sure you hit the block that matches your color!
If you hit the block that matches your color, the block will move sideways!
This is all I do all day long... I'm so hungry... Need...snack...
The  Button controls the lead guy! The  Button controls the guy in the back!
I'm gonna become the world's toughest Koopa! I'll be called... Um... Kooptaculon! Yeah!
Although... That would mean... Bowser would be MY underling...
Heh heh heh... Cool.
Ready?
Oh, yeah!
You Goomba! No playing hooky!
OK...
Ah ha ha ha ha!
I jump all year long! I...am...AWESOME!
Congratulations!
Excellent job, making it all the way here! Let me commemorate the moment with this! Take it, please!
What's that? You want even more commemoration?
Well! Aren't you the greedy one! No more for you!
You got Peasley Slacks!
AHH! How did THAT happen??? You guys are no slouches!
Derr... No matter what you hit me with, you can't knock me down.

At the moment you jump on him, press the  Button again!
See? You can jump higher than you can on your own! Indeed, it's jumping synergy!
Do you require another explanation? 
No
Yes
Very well, Luigi! Then use the High Jump you just learned to reach the ledge on the right!
Select High and then use  to perform the action.
Excellent work, men!
If you use your High Jump, you can climb ledges that you could never climb alone!
Select Mini and then use  to perform the action.

Eeyah ha ha ha!
O Great Bowletta!
At last we have the Beanstar! I am joyful!
You have done well!
Seeing through their fake Beanstar ruse and ruining their plan was brilliant!
Mariooo!
What's that? Do you need something? Or are you finally admitting defeat?
Huh? What? What are you saying? You want us to return Peach?
Oh, I have to laugh! We would never release Peach to scheming liars like you two!
You reap the beans you sow, fools! Now, meet your doom!
S-Something's wrong here...
T-Two princesses?!?
Wha-What is this?!?
Tee hee hee hee...
The Princess Peach you kidnapped...
...is an impostor!
We expected this to happen, so we prepared an impostor...
You fell into our trap!
No! It can't be!
Come, Mario, let us return!
W-Wait!!!
Eeyah ha ha ha!
Forget this cheap knockoff! I'm taking the real Princess Peach!
Heeeelllp!
Oh, Mario! Thank you!
I always believed you would save me.
The Beanstar is the protector of this land, and it has the power to grant any and all desires...
To prevent such power from being used for evil, the Beanstar was cast into a deep sleep...
It is said that a voice of great beauty is required to wake the Beanstar from its slumber.
It must be the voice of a pure and noble soul...
...In this day and age, Princess Peach is the only one who possesses such a voice.
So...the reason Cackletta stole Princess Peach's voice...
Aha! She must plan to awaken the Beanstar and fulfill all of her desires!

No! No! NO!!
An edict from Queen Bean of Beanbean Castle prohibits all entry to Woohoo Hooniversity!
You can pass.
...Or so I have been instructed to say. Hmmph.
G-Give back Prince Peasley!
Nnrrgh-GACK!
Y-You again! You are the pair of fink-rats that swooped in with the Bowser that I hate!
Hmph! HMPH, I say to you! While I was busy with Peasley, you have been catching me!
I have fury!
But Cackletta has already begun smearing the butter of her next tasty plan over Beanbean Castle!
Since you two cannot make it in time, I say to you that it is better never than late...
So here is your halting place!!!
Since you will not be shattering this stone, I laugh at you trying to climb down this mountain!
                    
Who are you guys? New deckhands? Don't even THINK about drinkin' the Chuckola Cola down in the hold!
We just applied some emergency cleanin' to that stinky old floor, so don't go boingin' around on it.

Master Mario! Master Luigi! This may be your chance to recover Princess Peach's voice!
I shall inform the locals that you are to be allowed passage on the road to Woohoo Hooniversity!
We will guard this castle to ensure it is not attacked again. Of this I assure you.
I intend to march into Woohoo Hooniversity right this instant!
May we meet again!
To get to Joke's End, you have no choice but to travel above the ocean waves...
Perhaps if you go to the beach you'll find a way to get there.
When we were attacked from the sky, I thought we were done for...
Apparently, there once was quite a fine surfing spot at one of this land's beaches...
Authorized personnel only!
Excellent! Then the two of you will execute our daring plan!
Oh, Mario Bros! This is our most desperate hour! The end of the Beanbean Kingdom may be at hand!
Bowser's Castle has unleashed an assault on the Beanbean Kingdom from the skies overhead!
This is Bowletta's doing!
We're utterly defenseless against an attack from the sky!
We have safely evacuated Princess Peach and the others to Little Fungitown.
...By the way, there's no sign of what's left of the Beanstar...
It apparently broke into four pieces, which seem to be lost...
And so, I am off yet again! I must sally forth to look for the pieces of the Beanstar!
You two can relax here and enjoy some sightseeing in our kingdom with fair Princess Peach.
Hmm... At least Princess Peach is safe... That's something.
But if we don't do something about Bowser's Castle, our poor kingdom may not survive...
...Eh? What's that, now? You know something about Bowser's Castle?
You say you know how to get from Bowser's room to the bathroom? What an odd thing to say...
Oh! I get it!
You're saying that you Mario Bros. know Bowser's Castle like the backs of your hands!
I, for one, feel very reassured knowing the Mario Bros. are going up to that horrible castle!
...No. This is our kingdom's problem. We cannot impose upon them any more than we have.
Oh, I almost forgot...
You won our little Beanstar wager, so here are your Mushroom coins: 99,999,999,999,999 of them!
Ah heh heh heh heh heh!
Perfect timing!
Heh heh heh!
Master Mario! Master Luigi! Head out to meet Prince Peasley!
While that certainly may be true...
Farewell!
Oh! Prince Peasley! Whatever are you doing?
You mustn't go to Bowser's Castle all alone...
Your Highness... Can we not think of a countermeasure ourselves?
Of course! Let us do just that. Cowering here will get us nothing.
Uh, this is just a thought, but isn't there someone who can fly anywhere in our kingdom?
If I were younger, I would cling to his legs and chase after the prince myself...
Ah... But just sitting here talking about it won't make it happen...
Cheers to Red and Greenie! Thank you for your help earlier!
Yes, thanks to you, my secret mission is about to pay off!
Prince Peasley! Excellent work on your mission!
Have you learned the whereabouts of Cackletta?
Thanks to you...
ABSOLUTELY!
Southeast of this castle is Woohoo Hooniversity, our local research institution.
Cackletta and her underlings have just snuck in there: into Woohoo Hooniversity!
At today's exchange rate, 99,999,999,999,999 Mushroom coins comes to...
Yes, of course! Woohoo Hooniversity is the perfect place to awaken the Beanstar!
99 Beanbean coins!
You did a splendid job handling that Cackletta problem!
We were all sweating about the ties between the Mushroom and Beanbean Kingdoms...
...It would be terrible if relations got soured!
The skies are raining destruction!
It's the end of everything!
The town will be destroyed!
We all gotta take refuge! You should, too!
The Goodwill Ambassador from the Beanbean Kingdom has arrived.
I wish to improve my kingdom's ties with the Mushroom Kingdom.
I bring a gift from Queen Bean.

Yeaaaah. Also, if ya have a Goomba, Boo, or Koopa Troopa amiibo, ya can let me know!

Ca-Cackletta and the odd, ugly, helmet-wearing one... They laid waste to the town.
It...It was so sudden. There wasn't anything we could do...
Whoa, get a look at that... I can hardly believe what I'm seein'!
As promised, here's your reward. Go on, it's yours!
They attacked while the Beanbean troops were in Hoohoo Village searching for Prince Peasley...
...
Received  coins!
We have to rebuild the town as soon as possible...
Cackletta went toward the castle after attacking the town... Queen Bean may be in danger!
It is said that the Beanstar is hidden up in Beanbean Castle.
What if... My gosh! What if Cackletta hopes to get her hands on the Beanstar? No! NOOOO!
Apparently this is the only store that's going to stay open with the town in such a bad state.
Have ya been collectin' stamps, bud?

Heya, bud! You heard about these things called stamps?
There's these rumors around town...
Seems there are these things called amiibo that can be used as stamps.
That's cool, that's cool. No worries, bud!
I've never seen one myself!
I'm embarrassed to ask, bud... But ya don't happen to have one of these amiibo stamps, do ya?
Received  of each bean type!
If ya have an amiibo, ya can get it ready to stamp!
I'll give ya a little somethin' if ya got one to show me!
Really?! Sweet! Can ya show me, bud?
Oh, wow! There's no mistakin' it. That's one of those stamps the rumors are talkin' about!

Yeaaaah. That's what. Farewell, bud!

I wonder if you can even make it over here...
This is a region map. It shows your current location and the location of Save Albums.
If you lose track of where you are, just check your map.
What should I do? What should I do?
Why did this happen?
Umm, I have to begin making repairs to the Castle Court Gardens... They're right above us...
The room on the right is called the Chest of Knowledge... It's full of useful tips for travelers.
That's where we keep a store of books left behind by adventurers who once visited our castle.
Check it out: We'll use it to make you the ultimate Hammer!
Hoo! Hoo! Hooo... Man, it feels so GREAT to be makin' Hammers again after such a long break!
In fact, it feels so darn great that we went ahead and made you guys TWO HAMMERS!
Look at that craftsmanship! POW! Now you're playin' with power!
Yeah! You got that right! These bad boys are now all yours!
You got Hammers!
You can use Solo Hammer Action!
I guess we oughta teach you guys how to properly use Hammers, huh?
...That's right. Pros all the way.
First, use the touch screen or the  or  Button to select the Hammer...
...But the thing is, in order to make Hammers, we need Hoohoo Blocks from the mountaintop.
And since Blablanadon suddenly stopped comin' down here, we can't get up to the summit!
Hammer
Hoohoo Blocks are hard stones. Hammers made from those things can break anything!
We want to climb the mountain to get more Hoohoo Blocks, but we can't jump well enough to do it!
Huh? Oh, yeah! What was I thinkin'? You guys are jumpin' pros, ain't you?
So, are you sayin' you could go to the top of the mountain and get us some Hoohoo Blocks?
That would REALLY hook us up! If you get us some Hoohoo Blocks, we'll make you a special Hammer!
You scratch our backs, Bros., and we'll scratch yours!
I'm Mallet, the younger of the Hammerhead Bros. My man over there is called Sledge.
Our Hammers are the greatest!
If you get us some Hoohoo Blocks, we'll make you a special Hammer!
Then press the  Button to whack stuff! That's it!
But, uh, right now, only the guy in front can use a Hammer!
Try whackin' all kinds of stuff with those Hammers. One manly whack breaks the hardest rocks!
Y'know, you oughta break that Hammer in by smashin' the rock in the next room!
Select the Hammer icon on the bottom screen and then press the  Button to swing!
You can switch between abilities using the  and  Buttons.
Actions that you boys do all on your own are called Solo Actions.
And that right there is the most basic of the basics. Don't forget it!
Th-This is the last stone! Now we show the true spirit of the Hammerhead Bros!
This stone's our last shot!
This is the home of the Hammerhead Bros., Sledge and Mallet.
Right now they're out looking for the rocks they use to make Hammers.
I'm sure they'll be back before too long.
Hmph! Boy, did YOU two arrive at exactly the right time!
Just now a Hoohoo Block fell down in the waterfall!
Haah... Hufff... Hoorf...
This...stone...just...ain't... gonna...do...it... We can't make Hammers no more...
Muh?!? What do you two think you're starin' at?
Huh? What? You want us to make you a Hammer???
Hey! I know these two dudes! They're Mario and Luigi from the Mushroom Kingdom!
The Jump and Hammer Kings!
Yeah! You're so right, Sledge! I remember these guys!
Why are a couple of celebrities like you bummin' around this place lookin' for a Hammer?
Oh! Hey... Look, you don't have to tell us. We fully understand...
Our lips are completely sealed... We'll just make what you need.
We're professionals, after all.

You tellin' me not to let my Beanlets loose? Oh! Right! Gotcha! Thanks, Bros., and good luck!
Um, excuse me, guys... This is kind of a dumb question, but, um...
You know when you jump on the other guy?
Well, what if just then, when the other guy was about to get, you know, jumped on...
What if he moved out of the way at the last second? What would happen? Don't you ever wonder?
Not that I need an answer... I wouldn't spend too much time thinking about it or anything.
The most important thing to do when traveling overseas is save. That's right. Save.
They say that saving is the best traveler's insurance around.
If you ever get homesick for the Mushroom Kingdom, you should visit Little Fungitown.
It's a town built by immigrants from the Mushroom Kingdom.
It's to the north of here, past Teehee Valley.
Sometimes you may feel lost in this unknown land. No big deal. Happens to the best of us!
If you're ever not sure where to go or what to do, have a gander at your mini map!
Woohoo Hooniversity is the center of all scientific research in the Beanbean Kingdom.
Apparently it's southeast of the town... Not that I've been there.
I'd love to study up and become a researcher at Woohoo Hooniversity!
Oh, my! Aren't you Mario and Luigi, the superstar brothers from the Mushroom Kingdom?
Wow! You're even cooler in person! But, uh... Prince Peasley is way cooler than you! No offense!
Yo yo yo yo, Bros! You two travelin' dudes!
I am, like, HURTIN' over here! In a big, BIG way, Bros!
Can't you help a bean out? 
Sorry
Sure
Weak! Then take off!
Seriously, Bros., my little pet Beanlets up and took off on me! Poor little dudelets...
If you can catch all 5 of 'em for me, I'll totally make it worth your while. You'll be like: "SCORE!"
Beanlets are all tiny and green and stuff, plus they're all round. You can't miss 'em, seriously.
The thing is, they ain't, you know, super-motivated, so no way those li'l dudes would've left town.
Come on, Bros! I KNOW you guys can take care of business! Get your super on!
Yo yo yo! Way to go, Bros! Only  more to go!
Beanlets are all tiny and green, and they're round and stuff. You can't miss the li'l dudelets, seriously.
Hurry up and find 'em! No time to chill, Bros!
Yo! My poor little Beanlet buddies! You got 'em all back for me!
Yo, many thanks, Bros! I'm practically cryin', I'm so relieved these dudelets are safe!
Anyway, right ON, Bros! Here's the reward I promised you!
HP fully restored! BP fully restored!
I theorize this: That perhaps the Beanstones were indeed buried and still rest beneath this very town!
I desire so greatly to dig this town down to its foundations... and even deeper if I must!
Yet how I am to even guess where to begin digging? Where? The mind recoils at the thought!
I ask you this: how happy would I be if the two of you were to dig up these artifacts for me?
Quite happy indeed! Of course, I could perhaps reward you.
Can you find the jewels of the Soybean civilization, the Beanstones? 
No
Yes
Perhaps I might suggest you have not yet managed to fully tap your intellects in this matter?
OHHHHH!
You have found all 10 of the Soybeans' sparkling Beanstones!
With this evidence, I can at last announce my hypothesis...
Perhaps!
Perhaps I should reward you for your endeavors!
I believe that you will accept this reward I promised you!
I think you two should follow my example so that you may one day understand the way of all things...
...Perhaps!
If ya happen to place a stamp in the Records menu, show me!
I'll give ya a little somethin' for your efforts!
Who'da thought, huh?
Stamp collectin' ain't just for letter-writers anymore!
Yeaaaah. Also, if ya have a Goomba, Boo, or Koopa Troopa amiibo, ya can let me know!

Nothing beats a cup every morning when you wake up. Without it, I think I'd just hate this town...
The thing about this kingdom is that there are all kinds of beans buried deep down in the soil.
Yeah, if you see a strange hollow in the ground, there's almost always something under there...
Of course, digging down to get stuff is such a pain that nobody ever bothers to do it.
So... Do ya have any amiibo... that look like this? 
No
Yes
Say! Have you heard? Oh, it's big news!
Prince Peasley is supposedly risking his life on a dangerous secret mission. 
But y'know!
I gotta say, I'd be devastated if anything were to happen to him! I just adore that guy!
Maybe I can help him on his next secret mission!

Received  Max Syrups!
And as for the whereabouts of the Beanstones, the heretofore hidden treasures of the Soybeans...
I have perhaps stumbled across some astounding facts related to this matter.
Fascinating! You are bold specimens!
I theorize that there are actually 10 Beanstones waiting to be unearthed. Yes, indeed.
If you recover all 10 for me, perhaps I might reward you...
By the by, my theory suggests the ancient Soybeans were, perhaps, rather on the short side...
Perhaps such information may provide you a clue of some sort in your Beanstone search...
Received  Super Nuts!
Hmmmmm...
I believe you still lack Beanstones...
 of them, to be exact...
If you obtain for me all 10 Beanstones that wait beneath this town, I may, perhaps, reward you.
By the way, my thesis suggests the ancient Soybeans were, perhaps, quite short...

I am perhaps this town's greatest intellect.
At present, it is the ancient Soybean civilization that has captured my focus and attention.
Would you like to hear my report on this great civilization of yore? 
No
Yes
Do you not think it wise to add to one's limited wisdom?
There's nothing to worry about now that the path is open.
If you've got a Hammer, you should try whacking all sorts of things. Whack-whackity-WHACK!
The bridge is broken, so we're repairing it. Go talk to villagers for a while and come back.
You can't climb the mountain until the bridge is fixed.
Soldiers come to town... Blablanadon fails to return... The bridge suddenly breaks...
I have a bad feeling about this. There could be something awful happening up on the mountain.
We're done fixing the bridge! If you're going to climb the mountain, be careful up there!
How was the view from the summit?
HP fully restored! BP fully restored!
I'm tired of living in the sticks. I want to live someplace cool, where there's lots to do!
If you head left, you can climb down to the mountain's base.
When the shopkeepers in this land see a fine, smooth mustache, they become strangely generous...
The higher your STACHE points are, the easier it is to get lucky hits in battle.
If you strike monsters with your Hammer as you enter battle, it will lower their SPEED at the fight's start.
Once you successfully perform a Bros. Attack multiple times, you will understand Super Attacks...
I've got a little game going on here.
Any chance you two might be interested in playing?
Do you want to take a shot at the Surfing Game? 
No
Yes
Want to hear the rules? 
No
Yes
Then good luck out there.
When you hit the course on the right side of this island, you'll see Oho Balloons floating all over the place. You can't miss them.

Ohoho... Yes, you spun me some mighty fine yarns, my friends.
Thank you for everything... You truly are superstars!
Have you superstars truly found % of all blocks?
I must know the truth of the matter!
Huh... You've unearthed % of the bean hollows...
Now it's time for me to leave this place and seek out the next great story...
Where will I go? Ohoho! Sorry. Can't say.
I'll probably never see you again... but I'm always in your corner. Ya dig?
Whoa... You've unearthed % of the bean hollows!
This is incredible! You've unearthed ALL of the bean hollows?!
Huh... You've found % of the blocks...
Have you superstars truly found ALL of the blocks?!
I must know the truth of the matter!
That so? Well then. Come back whenever you like.
Hm, yes! It satisfies me so to know the truth! A thousand thanks!
Hm, yes! It satisfies me so to know the truth! A thousand thanks!

Care to show me...your Records? Yeah. It'll be great.
Oh, wow! You've battled  times!
Hm? Why do I want to see 'em?
Well, ya know, going the extra mile... being an especially super superstar...
That kinda behavior makes me happy. Ya dig?
This is incredible! You've battled  times?!
Oh, and naturally, I'll give a nice reward for your efforts.
Provided the story you spin is good enough, that is...
Huh... You've defeated  foes...
Hmm... You've defeated  foes...

Sorry, but this story leaves much to be desired.
Try to beef up your records a bit. Do that, and then come back!
Hmm... You've received  Excellent ratings...

You got the Beanstar!
You got a fake Beanstar!
Hmm... But if he...she...uh, IT plans to return Princess Peach when we give it the Beanstar...
Then it can't be planning to use Peach's voice to awaken the Beanstar after all...
You got Peach's extra dress!
That would seem to be so!
Relax, all of you. We can just give the fiend THIS!
Oh! A fake Beanstar! Of course!
Also, please bring along a change of clothes for the princess.
I'm sure that Princess Peach likely tried to escape, doing untold damage to her lovely dress...
Just thinking of it drives me mad! Curse that Bowletta!
At least this old servant can help in some small way...
Joke's End is a palace at the sea's edge. It's covered in ice formed by cold responses to bad jokes.
Yes, it's a place where humor goes to die... It's impossible to walk there on the seafloor.
You must find a way to get there on the sea surface.
Say, by the way... I heard there used to be a hot surfing spot on the beach long ago.

If you plan to invade Bowser's Castle, then you are brave indeed...
The Beanstar will never be stolen again!
Uh, this is just a thought, but isn't there someone who can fly anywhere in our kingdom?
If I were younger, I would cling to his legs and chase after the prince myself...
Ah... But just sitting here talking about it won't make it happen...
The Beanstar is revived!
Drat it, I was sure something like this would happen! This is why I was against visiting Beanbean!
Hmm... So the Beanstar is finally back to normal...
A message has arrived from Bowletta. I shudder to think...
Very good!
You fools make fine scavengers!
Now, I want Red and Green to bring that Beanstar to me!
My name is... Bubbles.
And...I am the ultimate comedian, with the laughing and the chortling and the har har HAR!
Yes, monsieurs.
Indeed... What you see before you is the most legendary of sodas... The Chuckola Reserve...
And, I am pleased to tell you, this Chuckola Reserve...
...is yours to enjoy!
Har hee HAR! I have worked on Chuckola Reserve for 1000 years...
Telling it joke after joke, so it would mature, and then mature some more, and then yet more...
Until at last the greatest soda of all would be completed with the fizz and the tastiness.
Because it is a soda of such high caliber and repute...
rude guests meet a fate such as this...
Un...
Deux...
Trois!
Th-That's no ordinary soda, see?
We can't stand up to such a beverage!!!
Gahhhhh!
The great Chuckola Reserve is a thing to savor, with the flavor and tang and yum in the belly!
Ahhh... It is wonderful... So wonderful...
The great soda shines...
However!!!
That was not the only hidden soda power that my jokes have bred over these 1000 years!
Now I insist you fully experience the texture, taste, and aroma of Chuckola Reserve!
Bon appetit!
NOOOOOOO!!!
B-But the jokes! The puns! The humor I've saved up over the last 1000 years!!!
Au revoir!
What do idiots drink? So-duhhhh!
What do sodas call their dads? Pop!
A hippie's favorite soda? Granola cola!
Eeyah ha ha ha!
Oh, my... How has it come to this?
It seems we played our hand out, only to find the game is not over...
There is little we can do. For now, we must gather the Beanstar pieces as Bowletta demands.
Luckily, I know the general areas that the pieces fell in, so it shouldn't be too hard to find them.
Who will gather the pieces first? The esteemed Mario Bros? Or me?
I will bet 99,999,999,999,999 Mushroom coins that it will be me!
Do not scoff...for I do not intend to lose!!!
The game is afoot!
Master Mario! Master Luigi!!! We're counting on you!
Heed my directions well and you'll quickly find the Beanstar piece that landed in Teehee Valley!
I must say, my senses have been referred to as "strangely keen"!
Who would have thought that Cackletta could possess Bowser...
Check your map to see where the pieces of the Beanstar have fallen.
You-You must find the Beanstar pieces soon...for the princess!
Surely with my keen advice you can quickly find the piece that fell in Teehee Valley!
Eeyah ha ha ha!
The Beanstar is revived!
Master Mario! Master Luigi! Awful things transpired while you were off doing who-knows-what!
It looks like my hobbies will have to be shelved once again...
Your Highness!
Bowser...
No... Cackletta...
Uh, I mean... Bowletta... A message has arrived!
I beg of you! You must find the Beanstar so we can save dear Princess Peach!
You puny little worms are no match for me now!
I'm only going to say this once, so listen up!
If you want your precious princess returned safely...
Drat it, I was sure something like this would happen! This is why I was against visiting Beanbean!
Bring me the four pieces of the Beanstar!
I will contact you again once the Beanstar is complete!
Hmm... So the Beanstar is finally back to normal...
A message has arrived from Bowletta. I shudder to think...
Very good!
You fools make fine scavengers!
Now, I want Red and Green to bring that Beanstar to me!
Eeeyah ha ha ha ha!
This is a region map. It shows your current location and the location of Save Albums.
If you lose track of where you are, just check your map.
Whoa! Is this the thing that fell from the sky an' crashed into the hatch with a big ol' thud?!?
It's gotta be! And thanks to that, the hatch is busted!
This is terrible!
But hey! Whoa!
Jus' lookit this thing sparkle an' shine!
I dunno what this is, but I'm puttin' it in the hold!
Ow! Owie! Youchers!
What am I even doing?!
There are rumors that Lord Bowser has been spotted in this village...
Rawr! I'm starving!
LORD BOWSER!
Hey! Have you seen Lord Bowser?
Huh? Lord Who-Now?
Lord Bowser! He's got a big shell and is prone to grumpiness.
Ohhh, that guy. Yeah, I saw him.
WHAAA! A Mushroom ghost with wild eyebrows!!!
He went into the waterfall with a scummy food thief.
Where... Where am I...
Don't follow me, see? I've got places to be!
Mmm... Food...
There he is! THIEEEF!
Lord Bowser...
So, yeah. It seems rocks sometimes fall from the sky around here.
Wait... Do you gentlemen know that big guy?
You shouldn't get involved with a thief, you know!
Don't you dare call Lord Bowser a thief!
Yikes. What a mess...
Where's Lord Bowser? Where's Fawful?!
Hey, you! Which way to the castle?
Calm down, Mushroom. It's right at the base of this mountain.
Right! So I just need to climb down this mountain.
OK. Here I go!
Um...
Wait!!
For Lord Bowseeeer!
Don't you think that's going a bit overboard?
That's when the big guy fell down to this village here.
Hmph!
It takes more than THAT to harm the great Lord Bowser!
Huh?
Is that...a Goomba...?
Then a rock or somethin' fell down and hit him smack dab on the noggin.
Whoa. Are you OK?
BAH!
How long...was I unconscious?
Oh! Such ruckus!
Speak in softer voices!!
...
Up ahead USED to be where the Beanstar was kept...
Thanks to your efforts, Master Luigi, the Beanstar has returned to normal.
Looks like everything in town is back to normal.
We're lucky there was no major structural damage to the castle.
What should I do? What should I do?
Please help me...
Now, hear me! As you saw, the town is in ruins...
and the castle is under strict guard!
At a time like this I cannot allow a suspicious pair such as you to meet the queen!
As the queen's longest-serving lady at court, I must act in the interest of her royal safety!
Well! Master Mario! And Master Luigi!
I am Lady Lima, highest of the ladies at court...
The gatekeepers told me of you. Are you indeed the Mario and Luigi of fame? The superstars?
...Yes. I can't deny that such jumping is the hallmark of the Mario and Luigi of legend...
...Pardon me?
What are you trying to tell me?
Oh, DO speak up!
WOWSERS! You are something else!
But can you break 38 seconds next time around?
Wow!
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!
Enough already!
Here! Here is my present!
Want to try again? 
Yes
No
Another guy who looks just like me runs a little game on the island north of here.
I'm just waiting here in earnest.
You received a new recording! Listen to it in the Music player!
If you can pop all those balloons and reach the far island within one minute...
another guy who looks just like me will give you a great present!
If you get 'em all and reach the finish quickly, you'll get an even better present!
If you decide to quit midway through, just press START.
Finished!
Let's see how you did...
How many Oho Balloons remain? ...!!!
That's nothing to brag about! Well? Want to try again??? 
YES
No
Your elapsed time is over :00!!!
Your elapsed time is  seconds!!!
Uh, well, that was your first time, wasn't it?
Sorry, but that performance will earn you no prizes.
Try to do it in under 59 seconds next time!
Well, well... Have you gotten the hang of it yet?
Try for 50 seconds or less next time, OK?
Not bad. Not bad at all. But you've still got work to do.
See if you can do it in 45 seconds!
Wow! That's great! I must say, I'm shocked!
Try for 40 seconds or less next time, OK?
I'm going to stand watch to make sure no more monsters block the entrance to town!
Eeeeeeeek!
Mario! Luigi! HELP MEEEE!!!!!!
Oh... Mario... Luigi... Thank you! You saved me!
Tee hee... I wonder just what kind of town it is... Oooh, I can't wait!
Want to ride the lift? 
No
Yes
OK, Mario. And you, too, Luigi! Hop on!
Huh? Something that huge? That's impossible!
So, yeah, that monster blocking the gate to town was a huge problem, needless to say. Thanks!
P-Princess Peach! M-Mario Bros! We have been waiting for you!
We were told to expect you. Please! We insist you use the lift in back!
Zzz...
H-Hey, man... This looks bad... Uh... Go... Go rescue her!
Hey, man! Isn't that Mario?
Y-You're right! Talk about lucky!
It-It looks like they got it...
W-Welcome to Little Fungitown.
Look at Luigi! Always showing off his Luigi Dunk! Honestly!
Mario! I'll leave his welfare up to you! You can handle it.
I must return and move the Beanstar to a safer place!
I will see you later!
Master Mario... I must say... Being here is unhealthy for the princess as well.
We shall return to the castle ahead of you.
Shall we go, Princess?
He seems to be struggling somewhat over there...

Oh, I just hope he can escape safely...
Ah! Could that be him???
Heh heh heh heh heh heh!
Oh... Prince Peasley...
What a perfect landing! And the Beanstar made the trip just fine!
Master Mario! Master Luigi!
Hoo! Sorry to keep you waiting.
Now then, Master Mario, Master Luigi...
Please be sure to take the utmost, most diligent, sincerest care of Princess Peach!!!
I'll be back before you know it!
OK, Mario! And Luigi! Let's go to Little Fungitown!
Say... Where's Luigi?
Wah hah hah hah hah!

As a botanist, I must say I am quite interested in these Piranha Plants, loathsome as they may be.
Water can be easily extracted from the petals of the Piranha Plant. Did you know that? It's true.
The plants are said to hide below- ground so as not to be shocked by lightning when wet.

So I should head back the other way, then?
...I see.
Thank you! We're almost to Little Fungitown!
I am so relieved that Queen Bean has recovered! Belly Blech worms are just so...BLECCCCCHH!
May no harm come to our fair Queen Bean.
When we were attacked from the sky, I thought we were done for...
It would be great if no one attacked the town or castle anymore... Yeah, that'd be nice.
Why did this happen?
I'll be waiting here for you. If you want to leave this castle, just talk to me.
Want to return to Hoohoo Village? 
No
Yes
H-Hurry! We've gotta get out of this place! Now!
Mario! Do something super!
Attacking me when my back is turned, huh? Well, that's typical! C'mere, Super Coward Bros!!! 
Uh... W-Wait a second! Listen... This is no time for fighting! ...Even though I would've won!
Listen to me, everyone!!! Something terrible has happened!
The Goodwill Ambassador from our neighbor, the Beanbean Kingdom, just paid a visit!
Yeah! But it was no friendly visit! The ambassador stole Princess Peach's voice!
             
                              
         
                  
...A-And replaced it with this explosive vocabulary!
Gah! If I kidnap Princess Peach in this state, she'll wreck my castle!
Mario! Please! Go and retrieve Princess Peach's beautiful voice! Only you can do it!
The perpetrator came from the Beanbean Kingdom!
If you head over there, you should be able to learn more!
Bwa ha ha ha! Yes! Go, capture that fiend and get back Peach's voice! And then I can kidnap her!
We'll take my Koopa Cruiser and reach the Beanbean Kingdom in no time! Mario! We leave immediately!!
Along with a faint glimmer of hope, the Goomba Squad took the materials they had gathered and began their repair work on the Koopa Cruiser.
As they worked, they were filled with feelings about Bowser's Castle, which had been taken over... and about Lord Bowser, who was still missing...
They all hammered with all their hearts, taking out their fears on the bits of scrap metal before them...
They worked and worked...and then worked some more... UNTIL...
Such are the events that led to our fearless Goomba becoming Captain Goomba.
Captains have a lot of responsibility. They’re easy targets for opponents!
In fact, the enemy’s main goal is to defeat the captain.
It won’t take Captain Goomba long to learn just how difficult his new job really is...
This is a story of Minions. It unfolds as Mario and Luigi embark on an adventure all their own...
With the explosion of the Koopa Cruiser, Bowser's Minions were sent flying off to several distant locations...
One lone Goomba with ample gumption, who has been knocked unconscious in a far-off land, is in for a rude awakening...
You have my gratitude! Come now. Off we go.
This is a region map. It shows your current location and the location of Save Albums.
If you lose track of where you are, just check your map.
Eeeeeeeeek!

So I should head back the other way, then?

But for the time being, I'm leasing the place out to her.

Sorry about the mess.
With the town in this state, I'm only staying open as long as customers keep coming.
Only then shall you shoot forth a mighty blast of flame!
Perhaps you should try it once.
Yes... It is all coming back... I have been waiting for you. You want the Hand Power, right?
You want to master the fiery Hand Power known as the Firebrand, do you not?
You do, right? Right? RIGHT? You do not need to tell me. Your pose says it all.
I see no problem with your skill.
If you just do this action near something flammable, you should have no problems!
Surely this skill will open new paths in your life! Wouldn't you agree?
Don't worry... I only pretend to be dead. Ha ha funny.
I think I am myself, reborn!
Eebity-eh-eh-eccch!

Oh, waiting just burns me UP! But enough about that...

So... FAREWELL!

I have been waiting for you. I have waited many long years, smoldering like embers.
Huh? You, uh... This place...
Umm... This place of power...
It is, uh... This place is...
Now, wait a second... Just what kind of place was this, anyway?
What was it that I was planning on doing? Am I allowed in here?
Huh? Wait just a minute! Where am I? WHO am I???
...Hm! I guess having no guests for 3000 years takes a toll. Everything just seems to...
slip one's mind!
Har diddy HAR! How humorous! So! I guess you can do what you want! I won't stop you!
Oh! Wait! I just remembered!
This is the famed Fire Palace, where we teach the ways of the blistering Hand Power!
This is a region map. It shows your current location and the location of Save Albums.
If you lose track of where you are, just check your map.
There are 23 Oho Balloons in all.
You normally just pop out of the ground and get stomped, right?
I wonder why Lord Bowser even keeps you worms around.
Yeah! He's got the Koopalings! What more does he need?!
And yours truly will be playing a big part this time. Huge!
Let's be real. I always play the biggest part in our schemes.
Ha! We got a jokester here! You wanna fight about it?!
Bahahaha!
Idiots. Now, where was I? Oh, yeah! Goomba trash!
You scrubs won't be needed this time.
Just stay put and pretend you have a shot at greatness!
*sigh* I can't believe I got stomped AGAIN.
Oh, well. I'll beat that stupid Mario next time...
Let's band together next time. Strength in numbers and all.
HMM. That gives me an idea...
Us Goombas should up our game! Get some respect for a change!
Hey! What are you whispering about? Keep quiet, will ya?!
MINION! Are you done yet?
Master Roy! Yes, of course!
I just finished loading the last Goomba into a Goomba barrel!
Listen up, Goomba trash!
Are you nice and comfy in those dumb barrels?!
Hm? What's that?
ENEMY ATTACK, MY LORDSHIP! The cruiser has taken a hit!
Unacceptable! We'd better go and save the day!
Yeah! Let's wreck house!
W-Wait! I'm afraid it's too late for that...
Huh? The culprit's already been defeated?
Not exactly, my ladyness...
I'm afraid the main engine has sustained heavy damage...
The Koopa Cruiser will explode any moment!
SAY WHAT?!?
You have my gratitude! Come now. Off we go.
Eeeeeeeeek!

So I should head back the other way, then?

There is a place where you can learn Hand Powers.
Did you know that? 
Yes
No
Then, how about this? On the bottom-right part of your map, where all the rocks are...
There is a place where the Jellyfish Sisters will teach any who use Hand Power an incredible new technique.
Did you know that? 
Yes
No
I suppose that makes sense.
There's no reason you should know. ...In fact, I've only heard rumors of it myself.
Fine. You're no fun, smart guy.

Master Mario! Wait!
Oh, now I've done it!
Master Mario, I forgot to tell you one vital tidbit...and now just look at what has happened!
If you let the princess out of your sight like we just did, she'll get kidnapped instantly!
I beg of you: Rescue her and take care to ensure that you do not leave her side again.
And if the princess gets too far ahead of you, please stop her and talk some sense into her!
I have asked her to return by the same path she took if you should speak to her.
And with that... Good luck! I am counting on you!
So I should head back the other way, then?

Clearly this is a test for me. Yes, the powers-that-be want me to go out on my own.

Yeah, here comes destruction, ya couple of knuckleheads!

What's that? There's something on my face?
...O M-Master! Master! You mustn't listen! You can't listen!
All of this talk is just meant to swindle you out of your money again! It's all lies! LIIIIIIES!!
Eh? You say I look like Bubbles, the legendary soda maker?
I see... You just have to have the decoration on this sign...
(Wow! Yoshi faces... Everywhere!♪)
This sign is my theater's face.
You must find something else that can be used to decorate my grand sign, understood?
(So this is a movie theater...)
Why, do you mean... Neon Eggs?
This movie theater is now finally nearing completion.
They say this place was built for Yoshis by a great Yoshi enthusiast.
While we've certainly heard of Yoshis here in Beanbean, most people have never seen them...
This place could be all the rage!
Yes! I shall trade you this for the seven brilliant colors of the Neon Eggs!
I still need  more! Don't leave me hanging!
Heh heh heh... That's because...
Will the two of you agree to this?
When Yoshis eat a particular kind of food, they lay Neon Eggs, or so they say.
Inside that movie theater are seven hungry Yoshis...
So, find that particular food and give it to the Yoshis inside.
Once you get a Neon Egg, it means the Yoshi's stomach is filled. It also means...
I'm...
Everyone's happy!♪
Wah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You did it! You did it!
Bubbles's...
...Right?
Thanks to you two, my theater is now complete! Marvelous!
Very well! As promised... Here is your reward!
Younger brother!
In-Incredible, Master! Thinking not only of yourself...
...but of all the Yoshis, too!
My name is Boddle...
Younger brother of the legendary soda maker. As you can see, I'm rich enough to own my own theater.
I also happen to be president of the Yoshi Fan Club.
You two! Don't just stand there staring! Thank my master!
And once you're done thanking him, hurry up and get those Neon Eggs!!!
Hey! What's with you two?!?
This theater was designed by a Yoshi-loving chap specifically for the enjoyment of the Yoshis.
Now that you mention it, there is someone in this theater who's well versed in Neon Eggs.
You should talk to that individual about what food makes Yoshis lay Neon Eggs and where to find it.
Still a ways to go!
Halfway there!
Only one left to go!
You can't just waltz up and start talking to my master!
You weasels! Look at you! There's no doubt in my mind that you've come looking for money!
Well, I'll have you know that my master is very busy!
He doesn't have time to waste on the likes of you!
Be off! OFF, I say!
Huh? The Beanstar? Busted into four pieces?
Silence, you twit!
Excellent! We're going to be rather busy preparing for our grand opening! Pardon us!
HEY! What are YOU staring at?
You got a Beanstar piece!
Only  more to go!
You got a piece of the Beanstar!
Now you have all four pieces!
Hurry! Back to Beanbean Castle!
What's this?
Coming Soon! The Action Blockbuster: Mario & Luigi!
...That sounds so cool! Oooh, I can't wait!
Shh! Shh! If you understand, hurry up and find the Neon Eggs!
(Hooray!)
(It's complete!)
(Banzai!)
So, uh... What did you want to talk about?
...Yes, of course. Fine, fine.
I suppose I could decorate the sign with something else and give that sparkly thing to you...
No! No! You mustn't! Master, you mustn't!!
However... Only on one condition...
Im-Impossible, Master! Washed-up middle-aged men such as these could never get the Neon Eggs!
Hmm. Well done... I did well, asking you two.
My, Neon Eggs are beautiful. On the sign you go!

Hey, you! Stop!

Mario! Luigi!!! Thank you so much for all you've done.
I am so relieved that the two of you are safe.
I knew Cackletta was after the royal voice, so I beat them to the castle and warned the princess.
THIS is the Princess Peach whose voice was stolen!
And THAT is why the Beanstar reacted so strangely to her voice!
As you can see, every card in our hand truly was better than theirs.
Mario... Luigi... I am sorry to have caused you such trouble.
When the pair of you came rushing to the castle...
I intended to tell you the truth immediately, but Bowser beat you there...
And I lost my chance to spill the beans...so to speak...
But you defeated Cackletta nonetheless! And that is something to be congratulated for!
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho! Oh, terribly amusing! Yes. Come now, don't be so startled!
You see... I must tell you... Princess Peach's voice...
...was never stolen!

Hurry! Back to Beanbean Castle!
You'll find the Chuckola Reserve?
Eeyah ha ha ha!
Well... If you're going to make such bold proclamations, I suppose I have no choice but to rely on you...
Take this Beanbean Brooch and head southwest from the castle toward Chateau de Chucklehuck.
If you find the Chuckola Reserve hidden deep in Chucklehuck Woods, our queen may yet recover!
...
...Oh, no!
Cackletta forced Queen Bean to eat a Belly Blech worm! That's what turned her into THIS!
Our fair kingdom is doomed! Doomed! How will we ever return Queen Bean to normal?
At last... At long, long last...
I have in my possession both the Beanstar and Peach's voice!
Cackletta! It is the hurrying time! We must take that Beanstar and fastly run away from this place!
At last... At long, long last... I have in my possession both the Beanstar and Peach's voice!
Aww... We're too late! The Beanstar...
The Beanstar and Princess Peach's voice are already mine!
Once we awaken the Beanstar with Princess Peach's voice, this world will be Cackletta's snack cake!
Say, Mario Boys, you haven't bothered to pay a visit to your host, Queen Bean...
I thought you had better manners! Wouldn't you agree, Queen Bean?
Grrroo-hoo-hoo!
Perhaps the three of you can sit down over tea to discuss the finer points of foreign policy!
Huhn-gahhhhhhh!
...Wh-What's that you say? The Mario Bros. will do something about it?
What can you possibly mean? You speak of the impossible!
Why, there is no known way to spit out an ingested Belly Blech!
Well, except... There is that one way... That last resort... It sure isn't pretty, though...
She may be able to spit it up if she drank the legendary Chuckola Reserve from Chucklehuck Woods.
...You'll go to Chucklehuck Woods?
Eeyah ha ha ha!
Foolish Mario Bros! You have completely and pathetically fallen into my trap!
Repairing the plumbing is the key to disabling the Beanstar security system!
Take that Beanbean Brooch and head southwest from the castle toward Chateau de Chucklehuck.
You should be able to get to Chucklehuck Woods from there...
If you find the Chuckola Reserve hidden deep in Chucklehuck Woods, our queen may yet recover!
We don't have high expectations for you, but we'll be waiting nonetheless...

Master Mario! Master Luigi! This may be your chance to recover Princess Peach's voice!
I shall inform the locals that you are to be allowed passage on the road to Woohoo Hooniversity!
If you plan to head for Woohoo Hooniversity, proceed southeast from the castle.
This is splendid! Now if we can just find the Beanstar, it will be a happy ending for all!
Grooh... Groohoo... Gruuurgh...
Queen Bean has been in a deep sleep, just as you see her now.
Did you truly obtain some of the legendary Chuckola Reserve?
Ohhhh!!! Success! A truly repugnant, yet truly tremendous success!
Queen Bean has returned!
BLAAARF!!!
There's the Belly Blech worm!
EEYAH HEH HEH!
Ahh... That's the hardest I've laughed in a long, long time. Well done, Lady Lima!
No, Your Highness, it is not I, but rather the Mario Bros. whom you must thank.
Hmm... So, Cackletta has stolen Princess Peach's voice and the Beanstar...
Princess Peach's first formal visit to our kingdom has been finalized.
You should go to Beanbean Airport to greet the princess.
It was my fault...
Nonsense. But why would Cackletta steal the Beanstar and Princess Peach's voice in the first place?
Oh, Master Mario... Spot-on timing...
Mario, Luigi...
I was just speaking with Queen Bean...
She tells me there is a mushroom town in Beanbean Kingdom called Little Fungitown. Do you know of it?
It is a town full of Toads who have immigrated to this land.
Since we have come all the way to this land, I wish to pay an official royal visit to Little Fungitown...
That's acceptable in theory, but to reach Little Fungitown you must go north through Teehee Valley...
Teehee Valley is filled with vile monsters. It would be a little... No! VERY dangerous for Princess Peach.
As the royal representative of the senior Toads, I must vigorously oppose this idea!
Passing through unknown lands filled with monsters is absolutely absurd! Why, the very idea...
Koh-hoff! Ah-hem!
...And yet... I suppose if Mario and Luigi escorted you...
Perfect timing!
Your Highness! 
Master Mario! Master Luigi! Head out to meet Prince Peasley!
Prince Peasley has arrived!
Mario. Luigi. Since we seem to have come to a consensus...
Won't you take me to... Little Fungitown?
Will that do, Toadsworth?
As if I have any say in the matter! Just be very, very, very, very, very, very, very, VERY careful.
I must begin preparations immediately.
Mario, you and Luigi should meet us up north, at the entrance to Teehee Valley.
...And with that, please allow me to excuse myself, Queen Bean.
...Your princess is not only beautiful, but both wise and courageous, as well.
I am severely impressed!
Mario! Luigi! We have entrusted Princess Peach's safekeeping to the two of you!
Leave the castle town and head northeast to reach Teehee Valley.
And there's no mistaking her one true desire: to rule the world!
Fear not! I foresaw this desire of hers long, long ago!
We are prepared!
Card for card, we have a better hand than she!
Your Highness! Prince Peasley has arrived!
Prince Peasley, where were you...
Head out to meet Prince Peasley!
Just what cards have you drawn, Your Highness?

If this Oho Oasis far out in Oho Ocean, then that mean...
What that mean?
...How much is a chance?
...It has been three weeks since our research expedition arrived here. The time, it speeds by...
Today we made a most surprising discovery.
We approached a red Oho Jee and happened to ignite it in a bizarre accident...
The moment this red Oho Jee was touched by the flames, it turned into a monster!
This monster Oho Jee attacked us, as might any creature that dislikes being set on fire.
Unfortunately, the researcher who was attacked then transformed into an Oho Jee...
We must conclude that it is best not to approach an Oho Jee if one plans to set it afire.
Rather, it is better to stand a short distance away and then set fire to it, if one wishes.
Surely the blue Oho Jee will respond to some stimuli and also transform into monsters.
It may invite trouble, but clearly this must be researched more. Science demands it!

They say Boddle has over 30,000 wooden dolls at his house.
What's so fun about having so many wooden dolls?
I swear, I'll never understand the hobbies of the rich.
(I'm so hungry... I want to eat fruit...)
(Wow! Fruit! Thank you!)
(Oh, you can take that.)
(At first, they taste just like beans, but then the flavor of fruit oozes out...)
(Bean Fruit is the best!♪)
Mario, Luigi... A Game Arcade near here offers entertainment to the local residents.
I know there isn't anything like it in the Mushroom Kingdom, so I'm considering a visit.
Mario, have you and your brother been there yet?
Yes, I think I will visit it... a little bit later.
Ahh... Mario! Luigi! Please help the people of the Beanbean Kingdom! You must!
I wonder what's happening at Beanbean Castle now... I do hope Lady Lima is safe...
Master Mario! Master Luigi! You must do something about Bowser's Castle quickly!
Mario...
On a side note, according to recent research...
...frightful monsters such as these have settled into Guffawha Ruins.
How... How is he???
Hmmm... Green hue... Yes... Discoloration in the face... The symptoms seem to indicate...
Bean Fever! No mistaking it!
This illness afflicts many travelers who aren't used to the food in this region.
W-Well then... Can you cure him?
Had I the right remedy, I could cure him, but sadly, I'm all out.
At this rate, in three days...
He'll be a bean!!!
Rumors say that those who have been attacked by these monsters...
...have had their bones broken, their flesh stripped, and all their blood sucked out. ...Yuck.
...Well, that's what they say!
Oh, my! That's quite frightful!
But you're Luigi! You'll do just fine there, surely!
...Uh, right, Luigi?
You'll be fine, won't you?
This is for Mario's sake, right?
You WILL go, yes?
Look! That's true brotherly love! Sheer will is making his cowardly bones move. How inspiring!
Wow! Luigi! Your face looks so much more...manly!
Mr. Mario! Mr. Luigi! I heard you beat Cackletta, the evil witch threatening the Beanbean Kingdom!
Wow! You really are the superstars of the Mushroom Kingdom!
Surely now the Beanbean and Mushroom Kingdoms will have even more solid relations!
Crabbie Grass is said to grow in the depths of Guffawha Ruins.
You'll find the ruins if you just head due west from town.
It's somewhat dangerous, but west of this town lies a place known as...
Guffawha Ruins!
It is said that deep within Guffawha Ruins...
...there grows Crabbie Grass, an antidote to this fever.
Wh-What shall we do???
Luigi... Will you go to Guffawha Ruins?
Luigi, you're our only hope. Please come back safely. We'll be waiting for you.
Mario!!! The p-princess...!!!

Hey! The storage area's this way! If you wanna get in, you need a Membership Card for this boat!
An' if you want a Membership Card, try doin' somethin' that'll help out this boat!
Oh! Lookit that!
You got a Membership Card right there! Whoa!
Now that I know, I oughta be able to remember you by sight from now on.
Hey! Wassup? I know you!
You received a new recording! Listen to it in the Music player!
I have searched high and low for you two! I feared that you'd met a terrible fate!
Yes... It is true. The Beanstar split into four pieces. They have scattered. It is sad, really...
What? You say you'll help me search for the Beanstar pieces?
Of course, I would be most appreciative...
But actually, I'd like you two to go to Beanbean Airport.
Heh heh heh... You see...
Princess Peach is blessing our fair land with her presence!
A dignitary of Princess Peach's stature visiting our kingdom is a very serious affair.
And THAT is why I would like you two in attendance to greet Her Royal Loveliness.
As such, you must head for Beanbean Airport immediately!
Well, by the by, Beanbean Airport is south of Beanbean Castle.
I must head there myself immediately, so I'll see you there!
Huh? You want to cross the sea? Why, such a thing is impossible! Without a surfboard, that is...
Say... Maybe if you can find something to jam into that hole...
Maybe it'll make some sort of surfboard substitute! Maybe...　
Beanbean Beach → Surfing Spot
Yeah, the young prince is in a pickle, and that's no lie! I wonder if he'll come this way?
You! Move it!
You've GOT to hear this!!!
I'm back with humonstrous news and incredibling rumors!
Whoa! Is it about that strange- looking shining bean-thing that fell from the sky?
Wait... Is that the one everyone is saying Hermie found?
Yeah, the same! Hermie took that bean-thing and decorated his shell with it! That's the word, anyway.
I hear he looks just like a festive holiday tree!
Wow! Ker-razy! Cool!!!
We really should go take a look at it!
Yeah! That's a fantabulous idea! Let's do it!
If you two just lie there all day, you'll get wicked sunburned.
Hey... Have you heard those rumors about Prince Peasley?
Boy, I have! Lemme tell you! He's running around hunting high and low for something...

We must escape before it blows up and falls from the sky!
Make haste! I will meet you at the castle entrance!

Have you met Sledge and Mallet, the Hammer-making masters?
Having a house right above a bridge is strangely convenient.
You can dump the owner... Er... I mean the garbage...right into the water.
OOOOWEEEE!!! Emergency! Emergency! Mayday! Mayday!
Check it out: We'll use it to make you the ultimate Hammer!
Hoo! Hoo! Hooo... Man, it feels so GREAT to be makin' Hammers again after such a long break!
In fact, it feels so darn great that we went ahead and made you guys TWO HAMMERS!
Look at that craftsmanship! POW! Now you're playin' with power!

You got Hammers!
You can use Solo Hammer Action!
I guess we oughta teach you guys how to properly use Hammers, huh?
First, use the touch screen or the  or  Button to select the Hammer...
Hammer
Then press the  Button to whack stuff! That's it!
But, uh, right now, only the guy in front can use a Hammer!
Try whackin' all kinds of stuff with those Hammers. One manly whack breaks the hardest rocks!
Y'know, you oughta break that Hammer in by smashin' the rock in the next room!
Select the Hammer icon on the bottom screen and then press the  Button to swing!
You can switch between abilities using the  and  Buttons.
Actions that you boys do all on your own are called Solo Actions.
And that right there is the most basic of the basics. Don't forget it!
Hmph! Boy, did YOU two arrive at exactly the right time!
Just now a Hoohoo Block fell down in the waterfall!

To reach Hoohoo Mountain's peak, you have to either get a ride from Blablanadon or hike up.
Hiking the mountain is brutal, but if you can get a ride from Blablanadon, it's a snap!
I-I saw this kingdom's prince, Prince Peasley, on the edge of the village...
I-I'm sure of it! He was taken to the top of the mountain by some guy wearing a weird helmet...
Now that Blablanadon is back, I'm going right up to the summit.
We are said to be the descendants of the people who developed the Hoohoo civilization.
This land is largely populated by the Beanish peoples, but there are other races, like ours!

Don't worry... I only pretend to be dead. Ha ha funny.

It has been a week since our Oho Civilization Research Expedition reached this island.

Long ago, on this very mountain, the Hoohooligans developed the great Hoohoo civilization.
At the summit, there still remain many mysterious remnants of this once great people.
← Hoohoo Mountain Trail
...Huh? You want to climb down to where there's a town?
Then just keep heading left down this path.
The pictographs on the walls here are ancient letters known as Hooroglyphs.
They represent the countless jokes developed by the ancient Hoohoo civilization.
Oh! Masters Mario and Luigi!
Queen Bean was most pleased by your efforts at the Hooniversity!
By the way... There has been a slight hiccup in our plans to welcome Princess Peach.
You see, nasty Piranha Plants have dug their roots into this runway. Her airplane can't land!
Hmm? What? You want to know why repairs haven't been made?
Well, with the Cackletta incident, it didn't seem to be a priority.
...But, enough about that! You must do something about these disgusting Piranha Plants!
...For the sake of the princess! You can't refuse, can you?
Well, then! Show me that Mario Bros. work ethic I've heard so much about!
Even if you beat these Piranha Plants in battle, the roots sprout new plants almost immediately!
We've been looking forever for some other way to defeat them...
Well done, Mario Bros! Now we can welcome Princess Peach to our fair kingdom!
HP fully restored! BP fully restored!
Congratulations!
Excellent job, making it all the way here! Let me commemorate the moment with this! Take it, please!
What's that? You want even more commemoration?
Well! Aren't you the greedy one! No more for you!

Eh-hem! Pardon moi!
EEYARGH!
You've done well to make it here!
I should have expected as much from the superstars of the Mushroom Kingdom!
Unfortunately for you, those who desire to disrupt my plans have very short futures!
After conquering the Beanbean Kingdom, I intend to make the Mushroom Kingdom mine as well!
My new country has no need for old superstars!
It will do just fine with only one: the Great Bowletta!!!
It can't be!!! Impossible!!! I... No... How could I...
And to this filthy little pair! HOW COULD I LOSE?????
Cheers to the superstar siblings!
I have just finished rigging this castle with an explosive device!
We must escape before it blows up and falls from the sky!
Make haste! I will meet you at the castle entrance!
...Whoa... Wh-Where am I?
Wh-What have I been doing?
You're first, Green Bean!
Use the touch screen or the  or  Button to select Tickle...
Yeah! Make 'em feel it!
Right down that spine...
With electrical tickle power, you can push things with your back or walk from side to side.
Yeah! You can use this move to dash super-fast or even knock stuff over! Feel the power!
And now, the time has come to use it! Are you excited?
Great! Try to bump into me with your back!
Come on! Bring it!
Hurry up and push, Merri!!!
Nice!!! Yowser!!! Wowser!!!
Wow! You're a tickle technician!
Nice!!! Super!!! Duper!!!
You're a dash adept!!!
N-Next is the Red Pearl Bean! Oh, get it! Please!
Hurry! Quickly, now!!!
N-Next is the Green Pearl Bean! Oh, please! Get it! Get it!
Come on! Hurry! Faster!!!
Oh! Gigi!
I know this is being super-picky, but you're forgetting one thing!
Oh! That's right!
Of course... When you want to stop dashing...
Turn in any direction other than the one you're facing, or just press the  Button!
Listen, I don't mean to be a pill, but if you refuse, you'll have to pay for your lesson...
That won't do, sillies! You can't break the rock while you're accelerating or decelerating!
Go back and try again!
It's your turn next, Red.
Truly, THIS time, we've taught you everything that we can.
Select Dash, and then hold and release the  Button!
Choose Tickle, and then hold and release the  Button. Use  to move!
Build up your Thunder Power with the  Button...
Build it up... And when you just can't contain the electricity...
When you're about to explode... Release the  Button!
When you electrify the person in front of you with this move...
you can use  to both move on the same path!
No! That's wrong! I want you to hit me with your back! C'mon!
Charge up your Fire Power with the  Button...
Right down the spine!
Make it stingly!
Send a big jolt of electricity racing down the back! Yeah!
Choose Dash on the touch screen or with the  or  Button.
Super! Then let's get you a little practical experience!
I want you to dash right into this rock! C'mon!
When you feel the fiery power build to a dangerous level...
When you're about to ignite... release the  Button!
AHHHH-HYAHHHH!
Super! And that's all we have to teach you!
...Now that that's done, we have a little job for you!
That's right, Merri! We need you to use that technique to get the two Pearl Beans in this cave!
Your power is much, much more powerful than ours!
That's why you can get the two Pearl Beans! 
OK! All right! Hurry! Do it! We need both Pearl Beans! Yeah! Woo! Go! GO!
Oh, yeah! Nice! Sooo nice!!! A Red Pearl Bean!
Oh, good! Oh, good! SO GOOD!!! A Green Pearl Bean!
With power!
Tickle boldly!
Make 'em feel tickle fever as it burns, burns, BURRRRNS!
ハンドパワー
I wanted this so bad!!!
Oh, I'm swooning!
Where are you going! Hurry! Hurry up and try to hit me with your back!
It'll cost you 100,000 coins!!!
OK, Rookie! It's your turn, see? I want you to squash those red and green drips there!
Yes, Boss!
Red and Green... I feel like I know these two from somewhere... Weird...
Whaaat?!? Rookie! Are you saying you're acquainted with these two palookas?
Yeah... Something about them feels reeeeeeeeal familiar... It makes me feel...real mad!
Quit your babbling, you!
You two ugly mugs came here for the same reason as us! You want the fabled Chuckola Reserve!
Boo! Boo, I say! You really think you can beat me to the punch?
...Geh! ...Buh! ...Haaaaack!
Who took you in when you were dazed and lost on the mountain? Me! You worthless vermin!
Ooooh! Boo! Blast! Criminy!
I'm...so ashamed...
Meh! I don't care, see? We're fine as long as we get the Chuckola Reserve!
Let's not mess with these two knuckleheads. We'll scram and hurry on ahead! Yeah...
Rookie! You bloated idiot!
The famous shadow thief, Popple, has been caught in full sight!
Well, open up those ears, punks! I, Popple, shadow thief, filcher of the world's riches...
Cripes! You think you're ready, do ya? Well, nobody's more ready than me, see? I'll show you!
bet you that I get the Chuckola Reserve first!
Rookie! Go to it!
Rookie! Rookie! Shake a leg!
Yes, Boss!
Pick a warp pipe... : Decide: Back
While pressing the  and  Buttons, keep holding  upwards to climb.
OK! Grab on to me! We're going to Bowser's Castle!
Are you ready? 
No

Nuts for sale... Care to buy...?
That'll be...three for  coins... 
Don't buy

Oh... Maybe next time...
Thanks...
Now I have enough coins to buy Ma somethin' nice...

So...what are you guys going to do now?
Check out the mini-map if you forget where to head next!
The yellow arrow points to the place you should go to next.
This is Hoohoo Village, on the flanks of Hoohoo Mountain. The mountain is a sacred place.
I'll take you up to the summit!
Go to the summit? 
No
Yes
You'll have to walk back down if I take you up there... Is that OK? 
Never mind
No problem
If you climb down this mountain, you'll reach the town surrounding Beanbean Castle.
The townsfolk are so much more stylish and fashionable than people in this town. I just adore them!
No matter how long you wait, Blablanadon won't come back. I feel it in my bones.
He said he saw someone who looked like Prince Peasley, went to the summit, and never returned.
With Blablanadon gone, we can't get to the top of the mountain. This isn't good...
A meteorite fell down from above the waterfall and onto the Hammerhead Bros.' house!
I'm so glad Blablanadon is safe... Boy, is that a load off!
How many Chuckoroks did you get rid of...
Ah! That would be !
This is a very aromatic and highly valued type of bean.
Enjoy your reward.
Enjoy your reward.

...Oh, dear. Oh, my! Ohhh, BOY! Pardon us, sirs! SO sorry!
See, our kingdom's Prince Peasley was kidnapped by something...
...Or so recent reports out of Hoohoo Village claim.
We have been looking for any sign of the perpetrator.
According to eyewitness accounts, the prince's kidnapper...
...wore an odd helmet and spoke of mustard and fink-rats... That is all we have to go on.
If you come across anything, please let us know.
Reopen the investigation!
You fiends!!!
We... We've found you at last! You scum! What have you done with Prince Peasley?!?
Yes! There is no mistake! YOU kidnapped Prince Peasley!
We have witnesses! Now confess, villains!
What's that? You say you're Mario and Luigi?
Lies! Bald-faced lies! The superstars of the Mushroom Kingdom would never come here!
Nyeh... Nyeck nyehhh... They're not lying...
They say they've come here chasing someone called Cackletta... And they're really, really tough...
Yes! As long as you wear clothes from this shop, you'll be known as a sharp-dressed man among men!
As you can see, this is a fashion house frequented by celebrities of all kinds! Classy all the way!
But I offer prices you'd never expect from a high-class boutique!
Hoo Bean
Bahaha!
Please! Go up to the flag at the top of the cliff! That is all!
Hmm... Incredible! Master Mario! Master Luigi! You truly are super brothers! I salute you!
You have perfectly mastered the High Jump and Spin Jump!
Master Mario! Master Luigi! May your mission be successful! Good luck out there!
Move OUT!!!
Excellent. Now, the proving grounds! The time has come to show the fruits of your training!
You must use the High Jump and Spin Jump we just taught you...
...To reach the flag way up there! Good luck, soldiers!
Go up to the flag at the top of the cliff! STAT!

Stop training and return to the menu? 
No
Yes
Mr. Luigi? Is something the matter?
Huh-Huh-Hullo!!!
Princess Peach is ABSOLUTELY NOT in the room on the right!
H-H-Hello!
Princess Peach is in the room up ahead on the right!
I'm new here. And I'm nervous!
Unfiltered Water Warning
Beware of over-hydration! If over-drinking symptoms appear, stomp on the victim's head.
Spitting excess water on objects in this area is strictly prohibited.
Ah... The waterfall's mist feels so good... My pores are partying!
I wish we could stand here together...forever.
...Indeed, I am the architect who designed this very theater. I am called Fava.
And, also indeed, I am the older brother of the castle town's greatest intellectual.
First, dig the Bean Fruit out of the ground...
Then feed the Bean Fruit you dug up to a Yoshi...
Then you will get a Neon Egg! ...Perhaps!
...Perhaps!
Hrmm...
Oh my gosh! Yoshis! There really are Yoshis here! I've never seen one before! This is so cool!
I... I have to bring my girlfriend here! She'll flip out!
(Shut up...)
(This room is so dark... What do you do in a "theater" anyway?)
...What? What-what? What-what-what-what-WHAT? Ne-Neon Eggs, you say?
...How did you know that I'm a Neon Egg fiend?
Hmmmmmm...
I'm just an old man who loves Neon Eggs!
What?! You want to know what food makes Yoshis lay Neon Eggs?
Well, that'd be Bean Fruits! ...Perhaps!
Bean Fruits are native to Beanbean Kingdom. They grow underground. ...Perhaps!
But, you know, there's nothing wrong with an old man being a Neon Egg fiend.
I've never even found a single Neon Egg in all my life.
...Very well.
However... The knowledge I have gained after much collecting and searching is not exact...
But in my head, I have a map that shows kind of the general area where Bean Fruits may be.
Perhaps!
(These chairs look so cushy and comfortable...)
(Of course, I can't sit in them because my tail gets in the way. Ha ha!)
(I'm so hungry... I want to eat fruit...)
That's right! Some know me as an architect...
and some know me as an intellectual's older brother...
But in reality...
WHAAAT? What-WHAAAT? You're going to find them? And feed them to the Yoshis?
OK! I'll tell you! Indeed, I will now tell you!
I'll show you a map that points out the general location of some Bean Fruits!!!
I'll put marks on your map! ...Perhaps!
Go to the areas I marked on your map and look for suspicious spots surrounded by grass or rocks...
If you find such spots, there's no mistaking that a Bean Fruit lies in the dirt in that spot!
By the way, to dig up a Bean Fruit, just dig underground once and pop back up...
...Perhaps! If you're lucky!
(Wow! Fruit! Thank you!)
(Oh, you can take that.)
(At first, they taste just like beans, but then the flavor of fruit oozes out...)
(Bean Fruit is the best!♪)
Hmm... The Neon Eggs have at last appeared... Perhaps...
You say this sparkly thing is a piece of the Beanstar?
Bringin' this sparkly thing to the hold was a good idea, but where do we put it?
Whoa!!! Whuzzat???
And you say you two came here lookin' for it?
Hmm... Really? You want this thing?
Well... I GUESS I could give it to you...
But I gotta tell you, this thing busted our hatch.
I can't jus' give it to you for free...
All right!
Jus' get that guy Bloat off the wall up ahead!
Then I'll give this sparkly thing to you guys!
Those are the, y'know, conditions of the trade!
Wheee! Burrrp!
This Chuckola Cola fizz seeps right into your bones! BRAAP!
Hic! Don't you guys wanna join me for some refreshin' cola?
Hic! BOORP!
Come one! Come all! Have a look! Come see the pathetically inflated man, Bloat!!
He drank so much Chuckola Cola, he got stuck in this crack!
Plus, he forgot where he left the bombs for blowin' up walls!
Can't nothin' be done? Can't poor Bloat escape his fate?
Ooh ho ho ho ho ho!
Oh! Man! Cut it out! You're the most stubborn people I know! No girls would ever like you!

Excellent job, making it all the way here! Let me commemorate the moment with this! Take it, please!
What's that? You want even more commemoration?
Well! Aren't you the greedy one! No more for you!
You received a new recording! Listen to it in the Music player!
You got a Master Glove!
I'm terribly sorry, but Chuckola Cola is prohibited on airplanes. Any soda will be CONFISCATED!
Beanbean Air is busy with repairs at the moment. None of our planes are flying.
The plane carrying Princess Peach seems to be late.
I wonder why Princess Peach is coming to the Beanbean Kingdom.
All the rumors around town suggest a huuuuuuge VIP celebrity is coming from the Mushroom Kingdom.
I'm gonna get photographic evidence and sell it for big bucks to the town story collector, Miles Tones! Great plan, huh?
Mario... Luigi... Lady Lima is calling for you.
Please go to the runway up ahead.
As a meteorologist, I am particularly interested in the whirlwinds that appear in the seas in this area.
When rotational energy is added to warm updrafts of air, whirlwinds occur. It's quite fascinating.
...I would love to research this mechanism further and test it out somewhere.
This area is closed due to an emergency situation! Stay back, I say!

E-E-E-Emergency situation!
Did you see the Kingdom Courier?
By your leave, there is something we com-PLETELY forgot to mention to you earlier!
Affirmative! You see, when you master a technique in the field, you can also use it in battle!
We must confirm technique mastery with a combat simulation!
Thus we can officially confirm that these field techniques are indeed executable in battle!
Proper planning and preparation will ensure your safety throughout your journey! We wish you luck!
Move OUT!!!
Since you have mastered the High Jump and Spin Jump, you can now use these techniques in battle!
Mario and Luigi! Sirs!
This is an emotional reunion, sirs!
O... G-Great... Ca-Cackletta...
W-Will this guy...do?
Any... Anyone will do now... Hurry... Quickly...
Meanwhile, Near the Border...
This is a region map. It shows your current location and the location of Save Albums.

Hoo Bean
I hear Cackletta is trying to conquer the Beanbean Kingdom.
And now it seems the Koopalings are all working for Fawful...
They're already mounting attacks on all areas of the Beanbean Kingdom!
Huh. Honestly, I don't really care what happens to this kingdom...
The other Koopalings are trying to conquer this whole kingdom!
They've been brainwashed by "Lord" Fawful.
To be frank, they're all much stronger than you. How's that gonna work?
Please! Go up to the flag at the top of the cliff! That is all!
Hmm... Incredible! Master Mario! Master Luigi! You truly are super brothers! I salute you!
You have perfectly mastered the High Jump and Spin Jump!
Master Mario! Master Luigi! May your mission be successful! Good luck out there!
Move OUT!!!
Very well! We Starshade Bros. will teach you the secrets of Bros. Action!
Master Mario! Master Luigi! Special Bros. Action training shall commence immediately!
Sergeant Starshade! The shooting stars we just witnessed were an alien bombardment! ...Perhaps!
In the name of the Starshade Bros., we will find the alien scum! They will rue the day!
General Starshade! Sir! I have confirmed the presence of a suspicious unknown entity!
It is a vivid green color that pierces the eye!
Hmm! Yes! Sighting confirmed! However, I see not green, but red!
Urgent! Pursue additional visual contact immediately!
Oh! Incredible! It is none other than Mario from the Mushroom Kingdom!
Luigi sighting confirmed!
Sergeant Starshade! Change of mission objective! Obtain autographs, STAT!
Hmm... I see...
Incredible! To think... Princess Peach's lovely voice in the hands of some vile enemy!
Her voice must be recovered, no matter what it takes! Priority one, Sergeant Starshade!
We must provide as much field support as we can!
Are you ready to undergo training? 
No
Yes
Please! Feel free to address us whenever you are prepared to undergo training! That is all!
Excellent. Now, the proving grounds! The time has come to show the fruits of your training!
You must use the High Jump and Spin Jump we just taught you...
...To reach the flag way up there! Good luck, soldiers!
Go up to the flag at the top of the cliff! STAT!

COME HERE NOW.
I bet if you press the  and Buttons simultaneously, you'll both switch to the Solo Jump icon.
I bet that's useful for when there are little ledges you have to get up. Just a thought...
Sheesh! For some reason, my grandpa has been saying really bizarre things lately.
Maybe it's just his age. But he's so loud there's no ignoring him.

No, you're right. It's clearly an aura of stupidity...
My brothers...
We were only together for a short time, but it was...fun.
I'm sure we'll see each other again. Hammer lovers are bound by fate.
*sniffle* Brothers...
Hey. You know that all-powerful Ultra Hammer you told us about?
I believe in you! You'll definitely be able to make it!
Yeah...
Oh? Dang. Yeah, I'm out too.
Look! Over there!
My... My...
Hah! Take this Bowser to the away place!
My comrades!!!
You! Weird guy! Stop that!
What's your DEAL?!
Is it Fawful that you are speaking toward?!
Oh. Ahem. Sorry.
No, that cannot be truthful...
It is a "weird guy" that he is lobbing his words of filth at...
I was so overjoyed I had to... hug it out. You know how it goes.
Hey, weirdo! Halt!
Goombas don't "hug it out"!
Hooooaaaaah!
Oh, wow! Private Goomp! You're THE Private Goomp!
But we're Bowser's Minions! Bound by honor and the occasional awkward hug!
Back off, kid. I'll be taking credit for this one!
Now then! Shall we venture out, my fellow Goomba brethren?
Hey, ruffian! Keep your unworthy hands off Lord Bowser!
Shall we?
Finally! Some fellas who know about the finer things in life.
So you blokes have a love of Hammers, do ya?
HAH! That spray of experimentation is working like a charm filled with luck!
With this, no one will be able to have resistings of my power!
Mmm! And it comes in two fun flavors. I am liking the peppermint mocha...
Naturally! They're the best! Finally, someone who gets us.
Who knew there were others who shared our passion for Hammers?
Of course, Hammers can make any meeting impactful! Ha!
...Private Goomp?
Oh, that weird thingamabobber? That means you're the captain.
We need ya, Cap.
There's a guy called Mario who's also quite skilled with a Hammer...
But you two are nothin' to sneeze at either! No, sirree!
Hah! HAH, says Fawful!
Yep. Hoo boy, it sure looks great on ya. Special, even.
Mario?! That loser doesn't know a Hammer from a nail.
When it comes to Hammers, we're the experts!
This spray! It's the one he used to brainwash the Paragoombas!!
I see. So I'm the captain. Captain ME! Heh. Love it.
Ha! I love how smug you guys are!
Now is the time of telling me whose underling you are!
All right! Let's do this, team! Follow my lead, quick-like!
All right! It's decided!
Startin' today, you fellas are part of the family! We're brothers now!
This spray... It seems if you possess true Minion spirit...
Yeeeeaaah, nope, sorry. This isn't working for me.
Look! Over there! More Goombas!
Mallet! Get ready to work!
It's time to rebuild. We've gotta make a new workshop!
It has no effect!
I can't do it! The dizzying heights of captaindom are beyond my reach!
My friends! Thank goodness you're safe!
♪Hammers whack! Smackity smack!♪
That's right! We are none other than Lord Bowser's Minions!
Just LOOK at me! I don't even have arms! I'm just a Goomba...
This is great. You folks can join up with us too.
Hurry, Private Goomp!
Untold numbers of us have been stomped by Mario's stupid boots!
More soldiers, eh? Hey, um... Can we chat real quick?
What are you talking about? Isn't it obvious?!
Let's use our Minion spirit to beat this foul fiend together!
BWAAAAA!
Yeah, that's about what I said. Only in fewer words. And less dramatic.
What's on your mind, Cap?
We're Lord Bowser's... Bowser... Bow... Huh?
I am...Lord Fawful's faithful underling!
Yikes!
But I could tell right away you were the one! Our fearless captain!
That's just it. Being captain... Well, it isn't easy.
Have the saying of my name!
Wow... He was brainwashed so easily. That's depressing.
Is that...Lord Bowser?!
Coulda fooled me! That captain bit ya had going earlier was glorious!
You're a natural! Hard to explain how I know. It's a gut thing.
Lord... Lord Fawf...
Oh, no! I should...I should...
I should limber up with some warm-up exercises...
Yes... That is truth! You've got swagger to spare!
And that's half the job of being captain, probably!
Yes, that's it! I'm Lord Fawful's most faithful underling!
No way. Not happening. We're not going back!
Ooh, yeah... I'm ready for action now...
Huh... I thought you guys weren't even watching...
Good beastie! My pride swells like a toe that is stubbed and aching!
We've already decided to live as a family with these guys!
Sorry about Lord Bowser... Send him our best regards!
Fawful will inflict painful happenings upon all who oppose Lady Cackletta!
You don't understand! Lord Bowser is in big trouble right now!
Now! Let us move onward to the poundings of my enemies!
W-What? Really?!
As you wish, Lord Fawful!
Come on. Why don't you join us? Pretty please?
If that spray hits you, everyone looks like an enemy. Even Lord Bowser...
This situation seems complicated. We hate complicated things!
Oh, yeaaaah! I can DO this!
Enough blabberin' and wastin' time.
Let's settle this right now with a battle!
Wow. Cap is somethin' else.
Oooh, I like the sound of that! Let's fight, Goomba!
Argghhhhh!
Yeah. He's so simple. It's kinda charming!
Huh? What? Really? This got out of hand fast...
Bet we could get him to do anything if we stroked his ego enough, heh.
Huh. I think I can see that aura too... He should get that checked out.
The loser has to do whatever the winner says. Thinner makes tall!
Hm? Did you say something?
Youch!
Nope, nothing!
By the way... You look supercool when you smash your head like that.
Who's responsible for this? Who built a wall here?!
Geez, this guy sure is slow on the uptake. He doesn't seem to get it...
Really? Heh. I'm cool...
There's an aura all right. An aura of stupidity...
Such are the events that led to our fearless Goomba becoming Captain Goomba.
Captains have a lot of responsibility. They’re easy targets for opponents!
In fact, the enemy’s main goal is to defeat the captain.
It won’t take Captain Goomba long to learn just how difficult his new job really is...
Yeah!
Pretty much.
OK! For our parting gift... We'll sing the Hammer Song for you again!
You DO wanna hear it again, right? 
Umm...
Please, no.
That's cold...
Well, stop by any time you wanna hear it again!
Us Koopalings will look for Lord Bowser our own way. The RIGHT way.
Why wouldn't I talk?! That is IGNORANCE right there!
Just tap the Wrench icon on the bottom right of the Quest Select screen.
If you set "Replay events you've already seen" to ON...
you can relive scenes you've already experienced when you replay a quest!
No, please! Wait up!
Right. OK then. I'll get right on that.
Welp. That went poorly.
Now then! Bowser's Minions! Awaaay we go!
It's all crystal clear now. If I go and save Lord Bowser myself...
...the Koopalings might change their minds about me!
What's with you getting chummy so quickly? It's not very Minion-y.
Hmm. Ya know, this might be a good idea after all.
We could use another member for the squad.
Yeah, that's true.
Oh! Master Lemmy! Master Ludwig!
And we can stick him with...I mean... give him that super special position.
Thank goodness! Does this mean the Koopalings are unharmed?
What's this? Super special what now? Speak up, I say!
Huh. I thought a pebble was talking, but it's just a dumb Goomba.
Whatever it is, I promise to rise to the challenge!
Not that it's your business, but we're in search of Lord Bowser.
Time is of the essence, so we can't waste any of it talking to Goombas.
Cool. Together, we'll find our fellow Minions and rebuild our ranks!
Lord Bowser went flying that way, towards the mountain!
But watch out! A weird guy with odd verbiage might spray you!
Ooh, I love this plan! It's a great and grand plan!
Hm? I can't understand a word this nutty Goomba is saying...
Going alone is scary. It's not the Goomba way!
A good old-fashioned team-up is the way to go! Yes, indeed!
Come on, Ludwig!
Stop listening to that Goomba and let's get going!
Kablam!
Just one question... What's with that flag? The one UP THERE.
Hey, you! Paragoombas! Your allies have arrived!
No! Wait! I'm telling the truth!
Kapow!!!
Enemy sighted! This is not a drill!
Bowser's Minions are our mortal enemies!
You keep believing that idiotic story and see how far you get up the mountain.
Huh?!

My spray of brilliance is not having the effects on him...
Who needs Goombas with flags of foolishness anyway?!
Whoa... That weird bean thing just talked...
You've got Minion spirit! And pizzazz! And, um...dynamic eyebrows!
Lord Fawful!
♪Hammers are... HAMMERS!♪
Private Goomp! Have you come to your senses?!
Oh! Um... I guess... That came out wrong.
You're not a "weird" bean. You're, um...a great bean.
Sure, but...
Ahem. What are you doing?
Urghhh...
A squad's not a squad without a captain. Them's the facts.
Stop joking around, freak! Say your last words!
Oh... So he noticed that. Sharp one, this guy!
Oh! Uh.
Hah! Laughings and jubilations!
Just lookit that square jaw. It screams, "born to lead."
That flag you've got is even sparkling just for you!
Oh, great. TYPICAL. More weird bean things. Or, wait...
You don't GET IT, do you? We felt it in our blood!
There was this captain-y aura... It was all whoa and wow.
It helped us relax into the fight! Just as you intended!
Your leader is mine for the taking away!
I will work him until his bones become dust and the dust has grown mold!
Is it really? That's uncanny...
That gorgeous shape... is oddly familiar...
I have a captain-y aura? That's...awesome.
Now is when I have hurrying to the castle to retrieve the Beanstar!
The Captain... Captain THIS GUY... It definitely has a nice ring to it...
...But really, who's gonna be our captain? We need one of those!
Totally.
WAIT!
But can I really do it? Is that...allowed?
I can tell ya who it ain't gonna be. Ain't gonna be me, that's who.
Being captain comes with a lot of responsibility!
My own aura, eh...
If that guy with weird diction uses his spray on Lord Bowser—
I have no need for stupid mushroom faces with stupid eyebrows!
Yep.
Now that you mention it, I think I can see my aura too... It's purple.
I'll never let that happen! Hurry! To Lord Bowser!
Heh. Well then! This changes things considerably...
OK! Let's MOVE! Max aura power, gooo!
Wait! Do you even know which road will take us to him?!
Goomba Squaaaaad!
We're off on a grand adventure! We're off to rescue Lord Bowser!
Of course! Follow me!
Where's he going?
I think that road over there should do the trick...
I believe the phrase is, "Winner takes all."
That's our captain for ya...
Oh, or maybe it was this one here...
I have no idea what's happening, but I've just gotta win this!
Hm. I guess maybe it's that one.
Let's do this! To battle!
Is there something wrong with that Goomba?
There's some kind of smoky aura surrounding him...
We won! That means you'll join us, right?
That's not a "smoky" aura...
Yeah... That's right.
We ARE Bowser's Minions after all...
GAHHHHHHHHH!
Beanbean Borderland
Bow-Bowser fell... Urgh... ...on the other side... Ack! ...of the border...
F-Find Lord Bowser... Oh... Gack... Help us...
The K-Koopa Cruiser... We haven't finished... paying it off...
Congratulations!
Excellent job, making it all the way here! Let me commemorate the moment with this! Take it, please!
What's that? You want even more commemoration?
Well! Aren't you the greedy one! No more for you!
***Block Fortune***
Today's lucky block is... the Simu-Block.
If you hit the two Simu-Blocks up ahead simultaneously, your luck will improve!
The secret to hitting them simultaneously is to get on the top and bottom ledges!
This is a region map. It shows your current location and the location of Save Albums.

AHH! How did THAT happen??? You guys are no slouches!
Derr... No matter what you hit me with, you can't knock me down.

Gwarhar Lagoon Mysterious Items, Part 1 *** The Boo Statue ***
This is a beautiful statue carved in the likeness of the shy paranormal spirit, Boo.
If you stare wistfully at its spooooooky beauty... it will vanish with a POOF!
Invisible and untouchable. That is how mysterious it is.
Wh-Where am I...?!
Where's Peach... Wasn't I going to kidnap her...?
LORD BOWSER!!!
Quiet, fools!
Wait... Is this...my castle? I'm SO confused right now.
It is, milord! We won it back for you! *SNIFFLE*
Our r-real Lord Bowser is back! Waaaaaah! I'm so happy!!
What's your PROBLEM? You make me sick!
Not to interrupt this touching moment, but... Why is everything shaking?
Hurry, Lord Bowser! Let's go home, where we belong!
* Beanbean Bulletin * Disturbing Facts Uncovered in Area 64!
Recent studies show that the Spiky Stardust Defense System (SSDS) can be jumped!
It's easy! Just run, press the  Button and then immediately press the  Button!
Such a defense gap is apalling! Improvements are demanded to prevent an increase in intruders!
* Beanbean Bulletin 2 * Disturbing Facts Uncovered in Area 64!
Recent studies show that the Spiky Stardust Defense System (SSDS) can be jumped!
It's easy! Just run, and press !
Improvements are demanded to prevent an increase in intruders!
Eeyah ha ha ha!
At last, we have both Princess Peach and the Beanstar!
I still have rage over that fake Princess Peach...
Hmph! They're a slick bunch, huh?
And you, Princess Peach... You're a sly one, too!
By the way, Princess...
Why are you covering your mouth with your hands?
Eeyah ha ha ha!
Do you hide something?
Ack! Behind you!
A HUMONGOUS COCKROACH!
Fawful...
Did you see that?
Yes.
Mustache.
Yes.
...Fire at will.
GAHHHHHHHH!!!
How did you trick us?!?
Won't you please return my Mushroom to me? 
OK...
Nope.
Oh, thank you so much! Yes! But... Say, you're going to the Beanbean Kingdom soon, huh? You'd better keep it, then.
And please take this as a going-away gift! I insist!
Oh! Mario! Your mustache looks so silky-smooth today!
Show me that super jump!
And good luck with all your jumping and stuff over there in the Beanbean Kingdom!
I gotta admit, though... That explosive voice the princess has now is pretty exciting...♪
...But I think maybe it's a little TOO exciting! You've gotta bring her real voice back soon!
Practice your jumping so you can remember how high you can jump!
Kingdom Courier Vol. 1
Royal Speech Bombs!
The villain who stole the lovely voice of the princess has fled to the Beanbean Kingdom!
Mario has reportedly been tapped for the rescue mission.
As per usual, Luigi will stay home to guard the home front...?
Kingdom Courier Vol. 2
Mario & Bowser Team Up?
Our favorite hero, Mario, is leaving for Beanbean Kingdom with our least favorite villain, Bowser!
With Bowser's imminent departure from the kingdom, cries of joy were heard in Princess Peach's Castle.
Would you like an explanation of the Action Icons? 
No
Yes
If you press the  Button when this icon is showing, you'll jump. BOING! You're good at that, right?
Stand in front of someone and press the  Button when this icon appears to speak.
And when this icon appears, press the  Button to do a little investigating...
You'll see this icon when you stand near signs and things. Keep an eye out for it!
So, that's the fast and dirty explanation. Want to hear it again? 
No
Yes
Hey, by the way, is Luigi staying behind to keep an eye on the home front?
This is weird... I can't seem to find my precious belonging.
Mario! Do you think maybe you could help me look for it? 
Sure
Sorry
are symbols that show you what actions you can perform at any given time.
Some hero you are...
Come on! Please? Just help me find my precious belonging! 
OK
No way
I think I dropped it while I was walking up here, so focus on this ledge, OK?
You know, when you approach suspicious-looking areas, the Action Icon changes...
If I were you, I'd ask that guy near the fountain about the Action Icons!
Hey! That's it! That's the precious belonging I've been looking for! Thank you!
You are the best! The BEST! Please take this in return!
Oh! That was so awesome!♪
Mario, you're the only one in the whole world who can jump like that! You rule!
                    
It's just like I always say: If you see that mustache and that jump, it's Mario!
Oh, and I'd talk to everyone around here. Who knows what you might learn?
You found something precious!
So! Off on an adventure yet again!
...I just hope your long vacation hasn't left you out of shape.
You can stretch out and warm up here in this plaza.
That big, bad, mean, altogether nasty Bowser went rushing out toward the other exit!
Mario! Bowser isn't that way!
I've been trying to tell you he's not there! Don't you listen?
You know what? You're a real pest! And guess what else? You still can't go that way!
So, you're going to the Beanbean Kingdom?
Oh. I see. Fine, then. Great. Good luck in the Beanbean Kingdom. You'll need it.
Um, listen... Do you know where Lord Bowser has gone? 
Yes
No
That's quite a journey.
Do you want to learn about Action Icons before you go? 
No
Yes
Aha! You're really into learning about Action Icons, aren't you? 
No
Yes
Keep up the good work!
OK. This is lesson # ...
Oh, dear! Ack! Trouble! I've gotten separated from the Bowser Baddies...
You're really sort of a pest. OK. This is the last time...
Great! Which way did he go? 
→ That way 
↓ This way 
↑ Thatta way 
?   No idea
See, Action Icons are... Well... Go read the e-manual.
Oh, OK. Thanks. It's almost time to assemble, and boy, I can't miss that! I've gotta hurry!
Ha ha! Oh, all right, all right...
Oh, no! I'm gonna be late! This is not good!
Action Icons...
Ack! There's no exit!
Ouch!
Aww... I can't get that Mushroom up there! This is so lame!
My poor Mushroom!
Oh! Wow! My Mushroom! You got it for me? 
Of course
No
B-But... What? Awww...
*murmur* *gossip*
Lord Bowser! Everyone has assembled, as per your decree.
Th-Thank you, milord! My king! I won't let you down!
Hmph.
...Hm?
You...
The Goomba with the flag...
Yep... That's me, all right. Is there something else I can—
I have this strange feeling that we've met before...
On a mountain...in the Beanbean Kingdom...
Hm. I WAS on a mountain in the Beanbean Kingdom when...
BAH!!
That's the last thing I can remember...
After that, it all went black...
Together, the Minions worked tirelessly to rebuild Bowser's Castle in all its glory. Life was back to normal, and preparations were already underway to lay seige to Princess Peach's Castle once more.
Now! Onward to Peach's Castle!! But first...
The unexpected journey of Bowser's Minions in the Beanbean Kingdom had finally come to an end... After many hardships and many more Goomba tears, the Minions were finally able to return home.
Hmph!
Where's that shrimpy Goomba? The one with the weird flag?
Lord Bowser! Your Worshipfulness! You, uh...summoned me?
I've heard a lot about what you did in that dumb bean kingdom.
M-Milord! It was nothing!
Silence! I'm formally reinstating you as captain of my Minions.
Are you s-s-serious? ME?!
The next time Mario strikes, you will lead my Minions to victory!
Hah... Hahaha... Is it possible I was the one who—
IT WAS YOU!!
Eeeeeeek! Forgive me, my kiiiiiiiing!!

Go ahead and test out the strength of those bad boys!
Come back here again after a while!
You never know... We might be able to forge your Hammers again to make 'em even stronger!
Whoa!
I was wonderin' who that might be, and it turns out to be those Mario Bros. again!
You guys have the best timin'!
Why, we just now finished masterin' a brand-spankin' new Hammer-makin' technique!
Want us to re-reforge your Hammers for you?
In that case, this'll be the debut of our new Hammer-makin' technique! We'll get right to re-reforgin'!
Here we go!
On your toes!
Hooo... That's some fine work we did!
These are definitely the finest Hammers available! They're even more powerful than before!
With those Hammers, you can break any kind of rock! Any kind at all!
We've used all our talents in makin' these Hammers! May they serve you well!
Whoa!
I was wonderin' who that might be! It's the good ol' Mario Bros!
How have you guys been doin'? We moved out this way recently!
This new place is bigger than the old one, which makes it easier for us to do our work! Which is good.
Say, are those Hammers we made for you strikin' mighty blows?
Well, how 'bout we reforge 'em and power 'em up for you?
What do you say? It's free!
Reforge your Hammers? 
No
Yes
No... Please, no...
We're going after it!!
He's insane... Turns out he's actually insane!
This is...?!
BAH!
Goomba Squad! Is everyone OK?!
WHERE'S LORD BOWSER?!
Huh? The sky...
Whaaaaaa?!
Our next rival...is a plane. But we don't have the Koopa Cruiser anymore!
What should we do, Cap?
What should we do... Isn't it obvious?
Oh, and that's not all... Not remotely!
Touch the mini map on the bottom screen to view a map of your surroundings.
If you want all the juicy details, though, you gotta open up your suitcase and read the guide.
Press START to view the menu screen and check out that map.
Hold up, Bros!
Since we've been on duty, you two are the first people ever to cross our border. I mean, EVER!
We've gotta commemorate this occasion by giving you this!
As long as you have a map, you'll feel safer in foreign lands, right?
You received a new recording! Listen to it in the Music player!
*sniffle*
You were out for quite a while...
We weren't sure you'd ever get up again.
Are your burns feeling better?
Those who can't work with others are doomed to mediocrity.
Yeah... I'm fine.
Huh? What does that even mean?
Yeah, fine people always cry like that. Don't be so reckless next time, OK?
Sharing a burden with those you trust makes you stronger.
Keeheehee...
Ah. Yes. That sounds true.
Keeeeheehee!!
Lord Bowser is the same way.
Leeeave this place...
We shall negotiate amicably, oui? Talk eet out. Homme à monstre.
Probably. No...definitely. Eh, what do I know.
Leave nooooow...
Ummm, sure. Let's...do that. Sooo... Do you know where Master Iggy is?
Mmhmm. I kind of get it and kind of don't...
Terror awaits beyoooond this pooooint.
Master Eeggy?
In any case, let's move out.
Oh! It's a Boo! There's a Boo here.
Intéressant.
Before we go... What was that thing you said before?
OUCH!
Someone 'as been causing trouble een zee forest of late...

What's your problem?!
Eet must be zee fault of zis Master Eegy monstre!
How did you even know I was here?!
Hmm. If 'e weeshes to conquer zee forest...
zere eez but un place 'e could set up zee camp...
Did you not hear me?
Master Iggy instructed me to conquer this forest!
Why don't we do that and THEN save Lord Bowser?
Un place? Where's that?
I think we should give him the full rundown...
Aha! We 'ave gotteen to zee 'eart of zee matter!
Hmmm...
Een exchange for us telling vous where zat spot eez...

I don't understand any of this!
This is all I know for sure...
Non! Moi shall be staying right 'ere!
I WANNA GO HOME!!

There are no mansions here!
That's gotta be Lord Bowser!
Sacrebleu!
It smells weird!
Hey! You! What have you done with Lord Bowser?!
Eet eez 'ere! Un monstre!
And there are gross beans everywhere!
Cripes! If my master thief senses are as right as usual...
Cask! Mon frère! Deal weeth 'im!
Ever since I arrived here, I've felt...
That's my cue to exit!
Phew! We managed to find our way out...

HEY! Wait up!
Huh? Oh, it's just Larry.
Zee only glass zat could glow with such passion eez zee genuine article...

Um... Do I have a say in this?
Gangin' up on a fella is a rotten trick...

Monstres from un foreign land... Merci beaucoup!!

Lord Fawful is gonna be maaaad at yoooou! Bahahaha!
You're, um...welcome. So! Where's Master Iggy?
Calmez-vous, Cork! Zees eez actually good news for us deux.
Aha!
He's still brainwashed. He won't listen to us when he's like this.
We've got no choice but to pummel him.
Hmm.
Oh!
Ahem! Master Iggy!
To conquer zee forest, vous would set up zee camp at Mother Chuckalola.
That voice...
SNAP OUT OF IT!!
'Ere! Take zees. Eet eez un map to Mother Chuckalola.
YES! Things are looking up! Alrighty, let's head that way!
Yeah, this is great! An invisible captain is bound to be useful!
By zee way, zey say zose 'oo enter zee forest never return...
No... I just want a nice headpiece to block the sunlight...
Ah. Zey are gone again.
Don't worry, you'll be great! Three cheers for Captain Boo!
Beware zee dangerous sanctuary up ahead...
Eet eez filled with monstres! Many monstres!
Have zee caution and...
You recruited Boo! You can now choose Boo as your captain.
Bwaaahahaha!
Oh, no! Was Lord Bowser brainwashed too?
No... I don't believe so. It's something else.
Lord Bowser! It's me! Don't you remember me?!
Hey! Don't be reckless!
Let's hightail it outta here, Boss!
Lord Bowser! LORD BOWSER! It's me! Goomba!
Shut your mouth! I have no idea who you weirdos are!
Mark my words!
I'm going to become the greatest Shy Guy across all of history!
Hmph!
In fact, you should become my underling! Some of my esteem may rub off on you!
Please, Lord Bowser! Let's go back to your castle together!
Nah. I'm going to keep following Captain Goomba. He's good people.
I don't really care whether I become esteemed or not.
Huh? What?! Say that again!
I don't care whether I become esteemed or not.
No, the part before that! About good people!
I will not stand for such blatant indifference!
You WILL be my devoted underling, even if I have to take you by force!
Huh. I get the feeling we've been here already...
Ugh, it's so hard not to get lost in a place like this.
And I don't really understand the map we got from those old guys...
Arrrgh...
It's this way.
Looks like I'll have to recruit some underlings elsewhere...
Master Iggy is dead ahead.
Ummm... OK.
Look on the bright side. Lord Bowser is alive! We WILL find him again.
Among Bowser's Minions, the ones who laugh like that and act all creepy...
Well, they tend to be Boos.
We'll be stronger when we meet next. We'll find a way to make him remember!
You're rude. Has anyone ever told you that? You're a menace of a Minion!
That's true...
Well, at the least, you couldn't actually see me! ...Right?
Probably.
No, but if you laugh and carry on like that, it's easy to tell where you are.
Heh... Hehehe... Thanks. I feel a lot better now.
I don't get paid enough for this... 
Why did these fearless jokesters have to come along and ruin my day?
OK! Let's move out!
It's up to us! We MUST find Lord Bowser again!
Why don't you stop fooling around here and come with us?
Oh, that? Can't remember.
I am NOT fooling around!
I'm following Master Iggy's orders and conquering this forest!
Whaaat? Come on... Remembeeeer!
What will you do after you conquer it?
I saw it somewhere around here...
A gigantic shell that could only belong to the great Lord Bowser!
Hey! Sergeant Guy! What are you doing?
What will I do? Plenty of things! Like... And... You know, stuff!
Hey, Rookie! Where'd ya run off to?!
Huh? Me?
Look, we're going to go save Lord Bowser.
Would you like to join us?
Hey! You there! I got a question that needs answerin', see?
Huh?
Come on. Let's go. Together.
Have you palookas seen a big fella who looks all monster-like?
And what would that be?
Where did everyone go?
What? Really? I... Huh?
A big fella of a monster...
Behold zee captivating beauté of zee Green Goblet...
Sadly, zee accompanying Red Goblet 'as been stolen from us!
Oh! There they are.
*SNORT*
He had a shell on his back, see?
Zees beloved treasure, called zee miracle of le Beanbean Kingdom...
Since eet 'as been stolen, we are zee laughing stocks!
Wait... How did you guys get ahead of me?
You recruited Sergeant Guy!
A shell with spikes stickin' out of it, see?
We shall tell vous where Master Eeggy eez eef vous rescue zee Red Goblet!
Well, I guess it doesn't matter. Come on, let's keep moving!
Sharp claws and a real rugged look, see? Really though. You seen him?
Monstres from un foreign land... will vous agree to our terms?
Hey! Watch it!
Sounds like...a mean monster!
Yep. Sure thing. One Red Goblet, comin' right up.
By the way, who stole it from you?
BAAAH!
Master Iggy is supposed to be somewhere in the forest...
But we've been looking for ages and there are only trees in here!
Zee mal fiend 'oo stole zee Red Goblet was un red turtle monstre weeth weengs.
That's MY underling!
REALLY, REALLY UPSET!
Hm?
That sounds like... a Koopa Paratroopa!
Huh?! Wait a hot second... His flag is gone!
Then join us!
We'll get out of here and go back home to Bowser's Castle!
What IS that smell... It's so sweet... It practically melts in the air...
All right! Off we go!
But to do that, I'd have to disobey Master Iggy...
It makes me feel...happy... must...keep smelling it...
Fantastique!
What you're doing right now is disobeying Lord Bowser.
Ah... Mmm... My body is moving and smelling all on its own...
Hmm. You may have a point. Regardless, I hate it here...
It's like I can't get enough! Can't...stop smelling...
That tears it. I'm going with you!
No! Stop it, self! No... Don't stop...
However! I have one condition.
Is that...
What's with that weird Goomba? Why's he got a flag on his head?!
Makes me wanna grab a golf club and go for a hole-in-one!
Foooore! Bahahaha!
I'm just going to let this play out. It's pretty hilarious.
I want one of those stylish head flags too.
Could it be...
He was so happy to have found Lord Bowser... So sad Lord Bowser wasn't acting like himself... So embarrassed Lord Bowser didn't remember him... Lord Bowser's rejection burned like fire. And so Captain Goomba wept.
Larry! You need to smack some discipline into your underlings!
No problem! That means you'll be a captain too!
Dare I hope...
Anyway, I'm gonna go take out the rest of the woodland creatures, baha.
Huh? A captain? No, I just want the—
Lord Bows—
Later, losers!
BOOOOOSS!
No! Wait a second!
Hm? Zey are already gone?
Are you all right, Boss?
Who got ya?!
We're in big trouble...
Lord Bowser?! Lord Bowser!
Who knows if we'll be able to find him in this maze of trees...
So, you're the crooks who did this to Boss!
What are you doing?!
Say WHAT?!
Oh! Umm... Being confused? Let's see here...
Does this mean...you don't know who we are?!
Sergeant Guy is over there...
So this one is Sergeant Guy's Shy Guy underling...
Which means THIS one is MY Shy Guy friend...
OK. I get it now. But speaking of friends, where are Goomp and Paraplonk?
The Trio has officially split up! Who needs friends anyway!
I'm gonna go and join up with Master Iggy!
Yeah! I'll make a name for myself serving the great Master Iggy!
*snort*
HEY! Did you just ungracefully laugh at me through your nose?!
Let's all go home... It'll be just like old times...
HMPH!
Lord Bowser!
*sniffle* *SNIFFLE* WAAAAAAHHH!!
Captain Goomba started crying uncontrollably.
So, this is how it ends...
Come on—let's move. We need backup, and we need it NOW.
Do you...hear something?
I know I'm just a humble Goomba... just a run-of-the-mill Bowser fanboy.
At first, I never thought I could be a worthy captain for you fine Minions.
But then I met a quiet Shy Guy captain with still waters that run deep...
A mischievous Boo captain who's actually quite kind...
A Koopa Troopa captain who rhymes for attention but is beyond loyal...
The Notorious Koopalings... Private Goomp's Trio...
With every new member, the Goomba Squad grew stronger. And so did I!
That's how I know we'll be OK. NO ONE can beat this team.
Hop on...what?
Hop on ME!
How do we get to Lord Bowser?!
What ARE those things?!
We're not really going to fight. Am I right?
What would you have us do, Captain?
My friends! My BROTHERS! Our journey is at its end.
If we survive this next trial, Lord Bowser awaits us.
It's a double-edged sword to admit this, but...
Mario and Green Guy will surely defeat that faker.
Those guys are so strong... It make me SO MAD...
Anyway, that will give us the chance to rescue the real Lord Bowser.
And this time, we won't fail! We'll be at our king's side before the day is done!
Whether we're up against weird machines...or weirder Fawful...
Whether it's the green Mario Bro... or even Mario himself...
From this moment on, no matter what challenge we face, we WILL prevail!
So let's go show the world what we're made of!
This is for all the marbles! For our king!
Yeah! This is for you, Lord Bowser!!
GOOMBA SQUAAAD!!
CHAAAARGE!!!
You'll find that fiend this way!
That way? Are you sure? Wait... Who ARE you?!
Everyone! Hop on!
Congratulations!
Excellent job, making it all the way here! Let me commemorate the moment with this! Take it, please!
What's that? You want even more commemoration?
Well! Aren't you the greedy one! No more for you!
You got a Mush Badge AA!
You got Mushluck Pants!
Reveal yourself...
My king... My lord...
FAWFUL! I'm not talking to myself over here!
Lord Bowser!!
Hah! That was filled with success and sneaky havings.
Eeyah ha ha ha! You have done well.
Now those Minions I loathe and that Mario I despise will destroy each other!
M-My king! Thank you... I... I'm just glad you're safe.
Indeed. However... I am still unclear about something.
It's been such a long journey... *sniffle* I just... WAAAAHHH!!
Is there...some kind of meaning behind this hideous disguise?
I'M JUST SO HAPPY!!
Those Minions... The ones who follow that weird head-flag Goomba...
They have more trustings in Bowser than a rotund fink-rat has cheese!
I ask for your patience havings, O Great Cackletta!
W-Wait! I'm far too short on time to thank you right now!
Wh-What... OH, NO! This is BAD!!!
Even as we speak, that foolish Mario is on his way here.
Did you hear something, Fawful?
Starlow joined your ranks!
Prince Peasley joined your ranks!
Only my own voice full of musings and genius.
Oh. That's OK. Don't waste your royal breath on thanking me. How can I help?
Do what you were born to do. Destroy Mario!
Whoa there. Destroy him? I mean... Wow. OK then.
Lord Bowser, I know you're upset, but isn't that a little...much?
BEGONE!
Destroy Mario! Our eternal struggle ends now!
Right! You got it. One destroyed Mario, comin' right up.
Goomba Squad! MOVE OUT! Time to take down Mario!!
Why does this feel so...wrong? Huh. Must be something I ate...
Is this really where the story ends? Hmm. The truth might be hidden in Mario & Luigi's saga...
After much struggle and heartache, Captain Goomba finally defeated Fawful and rescued Lord Bowser.
Now he will rejoin the ranks of Bowser's Minions and battle against the mustachioed fiend called Mario, as per usual.
All is fine and well and as it should be...
...Or is it?
This is a region map. It shows your current location and the location of Save Albums.
If you lose track of where you are, just check your map.
Graaaaaaaargh!
M-MARIO!!! Green 'Stache!!!
You gotta get Princess Peach's voice back!
It's all up to you!
Hey! Mario!!! Great timing! I could use a hand here! I'm kind of...stuck.
Look, keep your diet jokes to yourself! They're not funny! Just get me out of here!!!
Nyeck nyeck nyeck!!!
Why, could it be that Bowser, the great Koopa King, has fallen into my cannon?!? Nyeck! How amusing!
Wh-Who dares speak to me so?
Nyeck nyeck nyeeeck! I am Tolstar, the great and famed king of Stardust Fields!
I've heard tales of you, but you aren't very impressive in person! Nyeeeck nyeck nyeck!
Nyeck nyeck! If you want me to get him out of there, little people, you must pay in coins!
I will set him free... for ALL of your coins!!!
And I'll even keep this most embarrassing incident a secret!
Wh-What?!? THAT'S NOT FAIR!!!
Pardon me? I'm not sure I heard you correctly just now! You'll give me all  of your coins?
Nyeck nyeck nyeeeck! Why, these are Mushroom Kingdom coins, aren't they?
This is the BEANBEAN Kingdom! ...I suppose I'll have to calculate their value in the local currency!
Let's see... At today's exchange rate... Mushroom coins... are worth 10 Beanbean coins!
Well, sorry, but for only 10 coins I can't guarantee this secret won't slip out! Nyeck nyeck!
...Yes, that means I'll need an additional 100 Beanbean coins!!!
Go find them in Stardust Fields and bring them back to me! Then I'll help your Koopa King!
Look around Stardust Fields and find me 100 coins!
You can find them in blocks or win them in battles. Check your menu to see how many you have!
Uh...nyeck? Let's see here... You now have  coins...
Hey! You haven't collected 100 coins yet! Deadbeats!
Hey! You haven't collected 100 coins yet! You bums!
To penalize you for your laziness, I'm going to revive ALL of the monsters you've defeated!
Nyeck! It took you long enough! But well done! I'll just be taking those coins now!
Nyeeeck! Very well done! I'll be taking those 100 coins now!
Finally! Let me outta here!!!
Huh? You want out? You want me to help you?
Who said I'd do that?
GRAGH! Swindler!
Nyeck nyeck! You're not in the Mushroom Kingdom anymore!
Outsiders begone!
You, sir, have been griping far too loudly for some time!
Derr... Once in a while I get the urge to go nap under a roof. Then I'll rent myself a room.
Derrr...but even then, they're rarely big enough for me.
This room is nice, isn't it?
It has a heater and a window and no old bath or toilet! It's 3 years old and 3 seconds to the cafe!
...But as nice as it is, you can't have it. I just now rented it to that fellow over there.
Such is the story of how Captain Goomba had his title and his snazzy flag taken away.
Even so, his accomplishments were acknowledged by his fellow Minions.
It is said that Goomba, formerly known as Captain Goomba, went on to become the top Minion in the fight against Mario and that one green guy. THE END.
Searching for Master Iggy.
Oh! Th-That's right!
Have they been brainwashed... or are they following Master Iggy?
That was quite a fall...
NOOO! That scrumptious smell is gone!!
...Huh?
What was I doing again?
Join me, comrades!!!
YEAAAAH!!!
Well done, Cap!
Whoa... Jumping into danger is NOT a smart idea.
Let's simmer, yeah? We don't wanna do anything reckless...
Bahahaha!
*sigh* You too?!
...You're still with me, right?
There it is! I SEE IT! Bowser's Castle!!
Can I have your attention, everyone?!
Lord Bowser awaits us in his castle! We must not fail!
Didn't Fawful say Lord Bowser is "not of this world anymore."
I know. I can't explain it... I just KNOW he's there.
There are undoubtedly tons of strong and scary enemies waiting to stop us.
But it matters not! The time is now! TO BOWSER'S CASTLE!!
I know I'm weak and small and remarkably unremarkable, but...
I don't like this.
Not one bit.
Oh...
You're talking like old you. All nervous and stuff. It's not very inspiring.
Are you our captain, or aren't you?!
You've got to sell it to the back row to get us in the fighting spirit!
OK! Now try that again, but this time, put some FEELING into it!
Heheh... I got this...
Breathe iiiiin... Breathe ouuuuut...
ATTENTION, all Minions! Report to Bowser's Castle!
Do NOT run, no matter what! Just keep fighting!!
We WILL rescue Lord Bowser! We WILL prevail! Together!
You can't get to Joke's End by walking on the seafloor, so don't try it, cretins.
Come after you learn how to cross the sea surface!
And don't lose the Beanstar on the way, butterfingers!
I have marked the areas where the pieces fell.
I recommend going to find this Beanstar piece first!
The drop point is at the far end of the ocean, at that crypt for cruddy jokes called Joke's End!
Lately, my dad has been spending all his time hanging around the new Game Arcade.
And boy, my mom is so mad! Which would be funny, except she goes and takes it out on me!
It's not easy for a kid when his parents are like this!
Oh! Hey! Mario! And Luigi! Did you say you two were guarding Princess Peach?
Wow! I knew it! Boy, my dad could learn a thing or two from you guys!
Oh, my! Mr. Mario isn't with you? Talk about odd...
Huh? You think you're Mario?
Oh...really. Well, umm...yeah! Uh...take care...and all...
